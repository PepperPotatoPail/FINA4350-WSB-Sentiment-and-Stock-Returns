>Making more than three day trades over any five trading day – not calendar day - window will flag you as a Pattern Day Trader (PDT) regardless of your account balance. FINRA regulations dictate that Pattern Day Traders must maintain at least $25,000 in portfolio value (stocks + cash) at all times to continue day trading.

>If you're flagged as a Pattern Day Trader,

>…and your portfolio value is $25,000 or more, you can continue day trading and won’t be restricted.
…but if your portfolio value drops below $25,000, you will be restricted from making additional day trades for 90 days.
As long as you end the previous trading day with a balance above $25,000, you will be able to place day trades the following day.

You're fucked.",Maintaining PDT balance question.,"Last week was pretty frustrating overall due to my hesitance to burn a day trade on a bad call. I can easily deposit the $25k+ to engage in day trading but I wanted to know how the maintenance of it goes. Can it never dip below $25k?

  I started investing back in December 2017 on Robinhood and was blessed with a free FB stock. My account gained around 2k in profits from the tech sector over the next few months. I lost that along with another 3k in June because I had 20k Twitter on margin with Robinhood gold and they got destroyed along with FB. I was at a 10k portfolio exactly a month ago. I was approved for options in June and finally was able to join you autists. I started seeing all these geniuses on wall street bets and decided to look for good DDs on here in the meantime while I learn more about different trading strategies.   Some of my positions that pushed me to 25k include cron, cgc, appl, amd, Yelp, sq, ba, and visa. I messed up a lot on FDs along the way and was going to buy lulu and Ulta FDs the other day but decided not to last second from my Best Buy burn Tuesday. The only thing I’m mad about at WSB is losing thousands of dollars on MU, but at least now I can fit in. Anyways, thanks for the advice and shitposts.

I just read about how that makes me a “toothless hillbilly” from another person wanting to short it. 

Here’s my DD. I recently bought a 2018 Ford Raptor. It was very expensive, most expensive purchase of my life. It took me for-fucking-ever to get one, even after I committed. I’d show up at lots (Atlanta area) and they would have 4 or 5, but they’d all be sold (except the fucking red one, every time). I found one at an AutoNation and left to go think about it. Went back the next day, sold. Another week or so later and I saw one (gray) and I went in, talked to the guy, went to the office, returned like 30 minutes later and the thing was sold. I couldn’t believe it. So I got talked into putting a deposit down, and had to wait like 3 more weeks before it arrived. It was ridiculous, but fuck I love that thing. 

Sales manager had been with Ford forever. Says they’re basically just going to start making trucks now, which they sell a shitload of. The Ford F-150 is the number one vehicle registered to millionaires in the United States. I’m not saying Ford doesn’t suck, they do, but their trucks are cool and if you disagree, you’re wrong. I think if they just focus on that and the customer experience for their large and better customer base (f150 owners) they could be alright. Fuck all those other cars though, I don’t even know why they make them. 

I don’t have a position in F. It’s boring to me, but that’s my $.02 on the subject.

&#x200B;

Last month I created [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/95675f/covered_calls_income/), and I said that I would follow up with how I am sticking to my covered call only strategy. My goal is to make $500 a month off of around $20,000 to $25,000 in investments, which is 24%-30% annually. Although I cheated and played with calls and puts, I stuck to the spirit of my original post and only SOLD these calls/puts.

&#x200B;

Here are [my trades](https://i.imgur.com/Ocyv0CM.png). I'll explain each one and plan what I should do next month.

&#x200B;

1. KR Put **\[NET GAIN: $8.40\]** : I had money sitting around so I wanted to sell a put. I didn't mind owning Kroger at that price either. I made $8.40 lol. Put expired worthless and the strike was $29.00. I did this trade before I made my original post.
2. TWTR Call **\[NET GAIN: $145.35\]** : I bought 100 shares for $32.05 and sold a call with a $32.50 strike. Twitter shot up so I bought my call back and sold the shares. Unfortunately, I was in class and did not calculate this on my spreadsheet, and due to commissions, this trade cost me $19.60. I should have let it expire. Although I did make $281.55 on the shares, buying back the call lost me $136.20. 
3. KR Call **\[NET GAIN: $85.35\]** : I bought 100 shares for $30.05 and sold a call with a $30.50 strike. I let the call expire and the shares get called away from me. I made $39.95 (not official, this will happen on Tuesday after Labor Day weekend) on the shares being called away and $45.40 on the premium collected for selling the call.
4. MU CALL **\[NET GAIN: $115.40\]** : I bought 100 shares for $52.52 per share. I sold a $54.50 strike call. I collected some SWEEEEET MU premium, and I still own the shares.
5. CVS CALL **\[NET GAIN: $205.73\]** : I love CVS. I've been selling calls on it for a while now. My cost basis (not including premiums collected before) is $68.73/share. $69.50 strike. I bought back the call a week before expiry and sold the shares. Doing that made me an additional $80 so that was a good call.
6. AMD PUT **\[NET GAIN: 60.40\]** : $19.50 strike. I wish I bought calls lol.
7. MU PUT **\[NET GAIN: $36.40\]** : I had already sold my shares of CVS and TWTR so I had cash sitting around. I figured I'd sell an MU put and collect some SWEEEEET MU premium. Sold the put with a strike of $50.50. *I haven't really gotten into strategies yet, but I think this is called a covered strangle*. This contract expired worthless. Even if it had been exercised, it would have let me reduce my cost basis on MU (shown in #3).
8. IQ CALL AND PUT **\[NET GAIN: $63.80\]** : Fuck IQ I guess lol. My cost basis was $33.50 from a put I sold last month. I sold a $33.50 call (expired worthless, collected $24.40). Also sold a $29.50 put (got exercised, collected $39.40). Now I have 200 shares at $31.24/share (decent I guess). The problem with IQ is that it dropped so low that I couldn't get decent premium until I sold the call and put on the 27th of August, so the Monday of the expiration week.

\*ALL THESE CONTRACTS EXPIRED THE 31ST, EXCEPT FOR #1

For the month of August, I made $720.83. The problem is any idiot could've made money this month, even though my main strategy (covered calls) is used for sideways or slightly bearish markets. I am hoping I can continue to make over $500/month in the coming months.

&#x200B;

I am considering using diagonal spreads to sell calls against, I need to research the strategy more. I am also considering buying 100 shares of $BABA and selling monthly calls (which is $500 premium for my chosen strikes) lol.

Lads, I've benefited quite a bit from multiple subs and wanted to give my two cents about a stock I see immense potential in(will put this elsewhere as well)

AVMXY is Avita medical. It's an Australian company listed as an OTC. Their claim to fame is a product called RECELL. 

What RECELL basically does is use a RES system which is regenerative epithelial suspension for burn victims. It is an autologous suspension that contains cells necessary to regenerate epidermis and provides a way to above closure if burn wounds. We all know burns aren't going away anytime soon and be seen in anyone from combat victims to fire victims or car accidents. Their product mainly comes into play for third degree burns and sometimes in second degree burns where skin grafting may be needed(taking skin from one part of the body and placing it on another). They did a multi centered randomized  controlled trial which was published which showed that patients who got their product RECELL essentially :
- required 97% less skin graft than those who did not
- had possible faster wound healing
- had less pain during recovery (burns are obv painful)

This is huge and potentially transformative for the burns industry. It is not currently approved but it's PMA application is currently being reviewed by the FDA and a decision is likely in Q3. The company is very confident that this will be approved and has already started production. Earlier in the year the FDA approved an increase in the number of patients who could be treated with RECELL under its compassionate use of investigational decide exemption program(basically allowing experimental therapy in extreme cases). They thus used it on 108 patients.this and its study results almost guarantees approval of the product which will be huge.

Imagine every burn center carrying Recell if it is approved. That's big.

I see one of a few possibilities:
-it gets listed on NASDAQ
- it gets bought out by another company
- nothing happens and it loses steam

I think the third is very unlikely given how this product can change management of burns. The first two possibilities are likely. It is currently $1.47/share which is still cheap. I can't predict how high it'll go but I do see an upward trajectory.

Constraints:
It is an OTC stock and these entail more risk than other stocks since they aren't as ""vetted."" That being said, they have already started in Europe and china so that's a good sign.
Also, interestingly it's been very quiet. Other than a couple of people mentioning it before, I haven't really seen it ""take off"" on Reddit. I believe mainly coz it's an OTC.

I see big things for AVMXY and I just bought quite a bit over the last week. FYI I am not trying to shamelessly promote this. I'm trying to give my two cents as DD and if you guys like please research the stock, company and the medical evidence. DONT  buy just coz I said so. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.

Maybe your analysis sucked?",Efficient market theory is absolute BS,"So I have been following AMD since 2015. Did a thorough analysis and full model last summer (=summer 2017). Indicated the stock was fairly valued at around $13. That's where I sold (bought at $5 and $10).

Now so far I pretty much agreed with efficient market theory (aka a stock price already instantly reflects all known public information)

Now since when the stock was $10, nothing has changed. Earnings pretty much matched forecasts, so did guidance. Intel's downfall for the next few years had been very obviously predictable in 2016.

Absolutely nothing changed, except analyst recommendations (RIP Toshiba Hari and all the fags). 

I just cannot believe ANALyst recommendations are the main thing driving the stock. They are just following like dumb sheep. Whether the stock is truly worth $50 or $10 I have no idea, but nothing warrants a 300% change in a few months on no new information, so efficient market theory is absolute trash.

There you go. Mecedes admits that they had to spend more then initially planned 12 billion to get an electric SUV production ready. That is one model ready and a few more to come. Compare that to Tesla having several models in production and several to come out. On top if that Tesla EV technology is probably several years ahead and they have a supercharging networks that traditional car makers don't have. Clear sign that the valuation of $TSLA at 51 billion right now is not at all exaggerated.

Naturally as a bagholder holding calls expiring in Janurary and October, I looked at the news that came out today.

&#x200B;

1. [George Soros Breaks up with Micron Stock, Boosts AMD Instead](https://www.smarteranalyst.com/hedge-funds/billionaire-george-soros-breaks-micron-mu-stock-boosts-advanced-micro-devices-amd-instead/)

This was the initial catalyst I figured that caused todays crash. No other semis dumped as hard as us, AMAT and LRCX were fine. If you read through that article, you will notice that Soros' holdings were only 400,000 shares, which is a little over 1% of the daily average volume.

&#x200B;

2. [Micron Delivers GDDR6 production performance as NVIDA launch partner](https://www.micron.com/about/blogs/2018/september/micron-delivers-gddr6-production-performance-as-nvidias-launch-partner)

In an article penned today, Micron is making RAM for the \~raytracer\~ cards.

&#x200B;

3. [ADATA DRAM revenue spikes 35% on demand in August, from July thanks to stable DRAM pricing](http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2018/09/05/2003699795)

&#x200B;

ADATA is a Taiwanese DRAM manufacturer. They reported 35% increase in monthly DRAM sales from July to August. Looks good for MU ER this month. I assume people are more interested in guidance for the next quarter however to confirm the cyclical theory.

&#x200B;

Here's the most interesting one.

&#x200B;

4.  [Samsung delays expansion of Taiwanese factory](https://money.udn.com/money/story/5612/3318769) (article from August 20th)

&#x200B;

One of the biggest things overhanging MU is the cyclical theory, that memory prices will collapse any time now and these companies will stop producing record profits. SK Hynix announced a delay to the expansion of their new facility a few weeks ago which triggered the initial 5% rally. However a rumour going to press in 6 hours on [Digitimes](https://www.digitimes.com/topic/bits+chips/memory_chips/) is that ""Samsung, SK Hynix reportedly to defer expansion plans"". No doubt this would reduce the supply that the cyclical meme relies on.

&#x200B;

At a [previous conference the CFO has talked about demand of NAND and other products](https://www.barrons.com/articles/micron-cfo-sees-incredibly-healthy-setup-for-nand-flash-in-2018-1515527031). Either way, new information entering the market.

&#x200B;

In summary, I have no idea why this is down. Figured fellow bagholders would like to see todays info. This stock is a real bitch.

I will make an argument for going long the stock and selling ITM covered calls....

On a fundamental level, I think there will be price support for the stock at a 6% yield since that's a very high yield for a company of Ford's market cap.

Also, Ford has enough free cash flow to cover dividends by nearly 5x.

Now, the strategy I'm considering (as of 9/6 closing prices)....

Buy F at $9.43
Sell Dec 21 $9.00 call for $.74
Max gain = $.15 divided + $.31 from call ($.74 call price - $.43 already ITM) =$.46

Annualized max return =$.46/$8.69 ($8.69 is Max loss after the partial hedge from the CC) or 5.3% annualized to ~18%. The max return will be achieved as long as the price of F is above $9.00 before Dec 21.

This will also allow for F to decline by 8% prior to Dec 21 before a loss is realized. Anything better than an 8% decline will result in a gain.

Good idea?

Worse case you'll be left with a stock yielding well over 7% and can then write $9 calls on that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9dmxlj/how_to_trade_ford_and_its_6_dividend_yield/,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9dmxlj/how_to_trade_ford_and_its_6_dividend_yield/

People need to BUY good companies and hold them for long time.  Buy low and sell high I don't even know how to stress this enough. Everywhere I read everyone has given up on poor Micron and I keep hearing about top of the cycle. Micron is the 15th most profitable company in the world right now. Let that sink in !! They are trading at a 3.89 PE which shows that in 3.89 years they can make up their entire market cap in pure cash.  They make a billion dollars a month in cash so everyday they are making 33+ million.

The competition is SK and Samsung who have already stopped expanding. The competition and MU will not let the last over production happen this cycle. In addition they are in the most up and coming industry of data centers, AI, autonomous driving, and IOT. Last cycle there were 7 memory manufacturers and now there is only 3.  It's impossible to just start up a memory chip plant as it takes years.

Even if this is the peak of the cycle they still have lowered their costs to manufacture DRAM, Forget NAND for a moment and just focus on memory. All these devices that we use everyday needs memory. Soon every car on the road are going to require SO much memory.  Data Centers are where it really is right now, however every one of these sectors is young and just now starting.

Today was the washout or capitulation of the longs. People finally had enough of these constant down days and threw in the towel. This is the time to buy ! They traded 96.5 million shares today where they average only about 36 million. On every message board people are dumping this stock and talking trash just like this post.

People need to give MU time and it will shine. The problem is everyone needs instant satisfaction so when it dips hard they cry like a little bitch. Today is the day you should back up the truck

Lastly the reason MU is the red headed step child is due to the unbelievable amount of CALLS that have been purchased over the last 5 months. From April this year to Jan 20 it was almost 900K calls which is INSANE. Does anyone really think the big funds are going to let those people walk away with that much money. Look at all the CALLS strikes going to 2020 and fortunately a lot have expired already and even more once we get out of September. After Sept 21 the over hang of so many CALLS really goes away.

LEAPs or shares only bro. Or short term puts. 

I see it going down to $150. Sentiment is extremely negative right now. That said if their next ER shows margin improvement, it will moon, otherwise it's going to languish. Fundamentally it's solid... if you are going long, you better bring your long game with you. 

I don't see regulation being a problem in the near term. No one has ever tried to regulate social media before. 

That said, strategically, it needs to needs to do the following:

1. Monetize Marketplace, it's ripe for turning into another Ebay of sorts. 
2. Simplify Facebook.com and limit how people can share. People love Instagram yet hate Facebook.com. Why? Because the site has become a fucking mess and that alone stresses people out. People may cite privacy but the reality is that people dislike their nitwit friends' meme posts and political rants. People don't want to read news articles full of nitwits' comments next to their best friend's wedding photos. It's too much. That's why people are not checking it as much, it's full of information overload and insanity. They should create several different feeds. 
3. Make events on Facebook even better. No reason why Facebook can't be another Eventbrite. Make it easier to search for events by geography and allow people to pay for tickets on the website or app. 
4. Start by taking privacy more seriously and market it that way. That starts by allowing people to use abbreviations of first names and last names, etc.

Didn't even read.,A Bullish Case for Tencent and Shopfiy,"SHOP is at the center of an Ecommerce BOOM! (Along with Amazon, but even Amazon and FB waived the white flag and partnered with SHOP vs competing with them.) Ecommerce currently makes up less than 14% of US retail sales and that number has steadily increased since 2010.

I've found that thesis and theme investing works very well. For example, Ecommerce continuing to expand and grow is my thesis. So who are the best two companies inside of the Ecommerce theme: SHOP and AMZN and their charts reflect that. 

My other thesis is that AI will revolutionize our economy more than the internet did. Data is key for AI and Tencent has data stores that make Google and Facebook salivate. Tencent is basically all of our apps rolled into one so you can imagine the immense amount of data they have on their user base which is more than double the population of America. TCEHY is an AI giant that has yet to execute its full potential (with all that data) but it's heavily investing into AI so I know TCEHY will be a winner in my AI theme investments just like SHOP and AMZN have been in my Ecommerce theme (AMZN is also AI which further adds to the greatness of their business and returns)

The technicals on TCEHY are terrible right now. It's consistently trading below the 50 DMA which is bearish, but it had that huge volume Spike on 8/15  and appears to be resting on/near a long term technical support level so it might be near rock bottom prices, but that doesn't mean it couldn't slip further down. But that volume spike may possibly be the start of a reversal or at least a strong base around that level. 

Shop is trading at a freaking steal right now. It's right on the 200 DMA which is a very strong level of support as you can see even from its past price history. So SHOP is in a technical uptrend resting on support and looks poised for a bounce up once this short term volatility settles down.

Everyone is focusing on Tencent's last quarter which had decreased margins. This is mainly due to working under the communist government of China. Tencent owns huge stakes in Epic Games (Fortnight and Gears of War developer) and ATVI (World of Warcraft, Call of Duty, and Starcraft developer) as well as fully owning League of Legends along with other mainstream titles. Gaming is only one part of their huge business. Anywho, China prohibited them from monatizing their games (such as the titles mentioned) so they're sitting on a huge untapped potential of earnings bc China is playing communist big brother. So they had smaller earnings margins than normal and everyone freaked out. Even in the short term, I think this is overblown given that it's mainly the government throddling them, but long term with AI, these highs and lows it has now will be small blips on its price chart. You can see the power of AI returns in the TTD chart. 

In conclusion, TCEHY is a fundamentally sound LONG term investment, but technically unsound/risky short term investment although it may have found a base, but it's too soon to be sure as it's yet to make a higher high or break the 50 DMA. SHOP is both a fundamentally and technically sound short and long term investment making it probably the best stock you could buy at this moment.

This isn't a contrarian play, it's just simple valuation. 

DD: 

-Intel's guidance was recently raised after a big beat.  They now expect 69.5 billion in sales and a non GAAP ePS of 4.15 (10.7% and 19.9% growth). That doesn't sound like a flat lining company to me 
-Yes, the stock got beat down after announcing a 2019 target date for release of 10nm Chip and AMD has been on a tear since then.  What the acting chief executives said on the call was that they aren't too worried about the server market share since they still have a 99% strangehold on the space and that their 14nm chips are competitive. 
-Significant investment in alternative spaces like Internet of things is paying huge dividends.  Revenue for this alone was 5.5 billion on last call.  
-Cash flow is a whopping 15 billion and under the current stock repurchase program they are poised to buy back almost 7 billion of stock in cash. 
-The AMD threat isn't new. It's 5 decades old and every single time AMD surges then gets destroyed.  Look it up if curious. Happens every ten years.  
-PEG factoring in current guidance is a paltry 1.2 which is ridiculous for a growth stock even if threats like Ryzen and smaller chips are factored in.  
- Stock has broken 50day MA and is testing 200day. Last time this happened was fall of 2017 and the stock then proceeded to rocket up 70%.  
-When the CEO resigned there was much talk of internal replacement but one by one the execs either turned it down or weren't vetted. Which is awesome. I think the board has the cash on hand to woo someone outside the company very desirable and that this announcement will happen a month before next earnings. The right person will maybe light a fire under the share price ... 

TL:DR Intel has a terrific amount of bad press because of AMD's recent coverage but some of us have seen this movie before and it always ends the same way. A new CEO is coming and the company is doing great financially.

MU announces big buyback awhile back. Stock doesn't really react ultimately trading at low 50s as of a few days ago. This is actually GOOD for MU. The lower their already undervalued stock price drops, the more they can recoup in a buyback. 

Yesterday when the CEO mentions NAND prices ""slipped somewhat"" this quarter, it was obvious that would scare people. His actual intent was to lower the value of MU slightly more for even better buyback opportunity.

My hunch is a large portion of the buyback occurs right before earnings on 9/20. That way, during the call, they announce the results of their buyback and post amazing numbers and good guidance sending MU to the MUUN.

Microsoft Azure

Microsoft Azure is continuing to gain market share and leads only second to Amazon’s AWS.  The competition is proving to be advantageous for Azure specifically in retail. Microsoft continues to expand Azure to three distinct sectors Retail, Financials, and Defense (FDR). 

Retail

On June 21,2017 the Wall Street Journal published an article reporting Wal-Mart was suggesting to their vendors, developers, and partners to consider moving off AWS for Azure \[1\].  This news came on the announcement of Amazon planning on acquiring Whole Foods Market.  Nearly a year later on July 17, 2018 Walmart announces they are establishing a strategic partnership with Microsoft \[2\].  The five-year agreement includes Azure and 365 for enterprise-wide use while working alongside Microsoft to move existing applications to the cloud, samsclub is also being moved over to Azure as well \[2\].  Microsoft also secured a deal with retailer Costco not to long after Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods.  Lowes also partnered up with Microsoft while its competitor Home Depot went with Google.

Financials

Retailers aren't the only companies partying in the clouds.  Saxo Bank partnered with Microsoft to move their banking platform to the cloud back in April 24, 2018 \[3\].  This partnership came nearly four months after Bank of America chose Microsoft as its personal cloud service \[4\].  Other financial institutions that subscribe to Microsoft and utilize its cloud include but aren’t limited to TD bank, UBS, and the State Bank of India \[5\]**.** The banking software company Temenos also partnered up with Microsoft to move existing apps and development into the cloud. Robinhood actually uses AWS in case you faggots were curious.

Defense 

With the deadline date for proposals to be submitted for the JEDI contract approaching despite the deadline extension to October it is important to note some of Microsoft's recent accomplishment in the terms of defense awards and contracts.  Near the closing weeks of 2016 Microsoft was awarded a contract valued over $900 million by the Department of Defense.  The contract was to bring Windows 10 to all four million of its employees and to provide tech support \[6\].  Microsoft did not back out of its contract with ICE for facial recognition technology because of internal disagreement \[7\] unlike its cohort Google which will not renew a contract with the pentagon due to internal employee discourse \[8\].  Back in May of this year Microsoft and Dell were awarded an agreement by the U.S. Intelligence Community which expands on the intelligence communities use of Microsoft products and services from Windows 10 to Cloud \[9\]

**Notable Sector Insurance**

**Insurance companies that partnered up with Microsoft to transition to the cloud that I’m too lazy to write about and source include Geico, MetLife, Liberty Mutual, Lockton Affinity, and Progressive.**

I don't normally like strangles (feels like betting red and black at the same time on roulette) but I've done this strategy on a few other earnings calls and walked away with solid profits. As long as it reacts significantly in one direction or another. If it trades totally sideways it'll suck.

Short the shit out of it.

* BTW Dave Morton who left now was at Seagate for 23 years. What made him leave Tesla after just a month ? What did he see in Tesla books that made him nope the fuck out of there ? CAO didn't receive $10M on his departure. $10M is stock options vested over 4 years. No signing bonus either. So he walked away w 1 month salary. Ask yourself, how bad the situation has to be?


https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dmf_AyQV4AAqTJ8.jpg:large


* Also the CAO said he left because of ""public scrutiny "" ? CAO is not a outside visibility job like CMO or CEO. So his reason for leaving makes no fucking sense.


* Also Tesla has existing obligations due soon -- $230 million due in November 2018 with conversion at $560 and $920 million due in March 2019 with conversion at $360. **I think their unrestricted cash right now is negative**.


* Also Look at the fucking bond rates - https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dmf2r2iXcAAv90e.jpg:large. Touching 82C.

* Another reason, Tesla's credit rating is based on them having 420K model 3 reservations. But yesterday without notice, they sent an email to everyone holding firesale of their Model 3s. Everyone can go to the store and pick up any Model 3 they want and **pay in cash**. WTF ? Its as if they are almost out of cash and 420K figure was a fraud.

https://forums.tesla.com/forum/forums/anybody-get-short-term-notice

Edit 1 :: I see some Musk dick suckers infesting this thread. If you ""invest"" in a company because you have a hard on for the CEO, its called ""gambling"" not ""investing"".  Also they talk about vague products in future like Model Y, Truck etc..

Enron Musk has allocated $0 CAPEX for these products. If you need to build these products then you need to start building assembly lines for it now . Where is the CAPEX ? He cant build stuff out of his ass.


* Also According to WSJ, their cash in first week of Q3 was 1.69B (https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-tesla-suppliers-fret-about-getting-paid-1534793592)


* 230MM is due in November, that leaves us with 1.46B with convert price of $560 (https://www.wsj.com/articles/sizing-up-teslas-10-billion-debt-stack-1529240400)

* 920MM due in March, that leaves us with **534MM** with convert price of $360

* But Tesla burns $1B every quarter and Enron Musk's recent blog posted on Friday has no reiteration of Q3 profits


If they dont raise within next 3 months, BK is imminent. **They will have no cash left in Q4 if you account for upcoming bond payments**

Also Tesla cannot do equity raise to pay back the bonds, the bonds need to be paid in cash. Because equity raise would dilute shares and share price will drop even more.


Edit 2 : Tesla is sending reservation invites to people to pick up car today on first come first serve basis, **even to those who dont have reservations aka spamming** ! The 420 K reservations number is a giant fraud

**Geron**  $GERN – Short term buy

As opposed to the more common AML and CML, myoproliferative neoplasms don’t have substantial clonal chromosomal abnormalities. The aforementioned AML and CML have very common chromosomal translocations – one of the reliable ones was the BCR-ABL fusion – which lead to the so called Philadelphia chromosome – and the huge success of Gleevec. Myoproliferative neoplasms don’t seem to have those huge rearrangements. Recent sequencing studies have pointed towards FLT3, JAK2, MPL, and RAS mutations being associated – but so far they haven’t proven to be great targets. RAS has never been a good target, despite being one of, if not the first oncogene discovered. Imeltestat targets Telomerase. I’m not going too in depth about telomeres, however consistent proliferation of these cells (aka cancer), will lead to the telomeres eventually disappearing. So the cancer’s have to “learn” how to turn Telomerase back on if they want to keep proliferating. Imeltestat prevents telomerase from doing its deal. 

&#x200B;

The downside to Geron are that they are a 1 trick pony. All their eggs so to speak are in the Imeltestat basket along with their partnership with JnJ (albeit 100 mill in bank). I don’t think targeting telomerase will “cure” these neoplasms or contribute to PFS in any meaningful way. However, it could lead to really good extension of life. 

&#x200B;

Imeltestat is on JnJ’s current list of compassionate use drugs – which is a good sign. Anyways, JnJ will have to give their decision soon – which will be a 65 million dollar payment, and then structured rewards of up to 800 based on the clinical trials. On the down side, Imeltestat has been associated with a shit ton of adverse events. 

&#x200B;

If JnJ decides to not pick up the partnership, expect the stock to crater. The IV is huge for the options, so you’re looking at a huge move in order to make any money. However, this is prime WSB Yolo material. Its going to be at either +50% or -80% within 2 weeks. I’m buying stonk, and puts at $5 for some semblance of downside protection.

**Omeros $OMER** – Strong buy short term and long. 

I find tons to like in this company. They really have a ton in the pipeline with a bunch of different diseases, which is really unusual. They have several shots on goal for their most developed lead, OMS721 (aka trials in several different disease spaces). They should have some data coming soon on the IgA Nephropathy – which is a very common kidney disease. OMS721 targets a portion of the innate immune system as opposed to the adaptive immune system (the one you hear most commonly about).   This is a Phase III trial, so you would expect a big pop if it looks good.  

&#x200B;

I’m really a big fan of their pipeline. PDE7 and PDE10 are both really interesting targets. Dart Neuro - prior to their folding - was really a PDE10 company, and there is a lot of literature that backs up PDE10 being a potential treatment for Alzheimers. Also given that PDE10 inhibition doesn't work on anything specifically with Alzheimers, I'm guessing we'll get a ton of off label boomers using it.  PDE7 I think is a little more exciting. It is mainly present in both Immune cells and Neurons, and its activation can cause neuroinflammation. There is some good evidence that PDE7 inhibition can help with both Alcoholism and Opiod addiction, a space that has significant unmet needs. They are targeting movement disorders as well (AKA parkinsons), which I find a little quizzical, but will read more into. Given that the company has survived for quite some time, and still has a fairly healthy balance sheet, I think it’s a great short term and long term buy. There is while significant short term downside risk if OMS721 fails, I don’t think their totally nuked like some of the other biotechs are. 

&#x200B;

The other really impressive thing is beyond their mix of diseases and targets, is that they’ve proven themselves to be competent in both the antibody space (OMS721), and the small molecule space (PDE7, PDE10, pparg) - plus their approved therapy (Omidria) Also they can run clinical trials. Also they’re developing platforms. Seriously, WTF? Its rare to see even larger companies this aggressive with different spaces. This all speaks volumes about leadership competency. They apparently are hiring a ton, because there are a bunch of job listings (75 ish) on linkedin  - which means the management has to be pretty bullish. On the flipside, glassdoor isn’t too kind to them. 

&#x200B;

I'm buying  NOV16 26C, OCT19 30C, and Stonk.  

&#x200B;

I'm not certain we'll hear the OMS721 data prior to Oct19, hence my going a little further OTM for the lottery ticket play.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9egsrj/some_september_biotech_dd/,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9egsrj/some_september_biotech_dd/

I anticipate a strong market rally coming, probably Monday - it is my belief that this latest recession was profit taking. However it is also my belief that this rally may be very aggressive but short lived.

&#x200B;

**Nasdaq 100**

Nasdaq saw the most drawdown out of all the indices that I will cover.

The first chart below is the /NQ on a daily time frame. One can see that price broke down out of this uptrending channel that began forming in April of 2018. This breakdown of the channel support is a big bearish event that was supposed to happen the week prior but the market was juiced up instead once more.

[https://i.imgur.com/Es9wClW.png](https://i.imgur.com/Es9wClW.png)

In any case, a real market sell off will not happen until we have a rejection on the pullback to the channel support. See this next image to see what I mean.

[https://imgur.com/a/Ol5NDEd](https://imgur.com/a/Ol5NDEd)

The real reason I am bullish short term is due to the 1 hour chart. One can see that there is a clear downtrending resistance line taking shape from where the sell off first started. We can see that a strong base has formed at the 7400 level and more importantly we had a massive engulfing hourly candle on Friday at 9 am. I believe we would have rallied last Friday but that Trump tweet at lunch threw a wrench in the market manipulators’ plans.

It appears now that price is breaking out again in the overnight session but we won’t trust it completely until we see a successful throwback to the resistance line followed by a bounce.

[https://imgur.com/a/1wSmEP4](https://imgur.com/a/1wSmEP4)

&#x200B;

**S&P 500**

The S&P 500 has the strongest bullish reasoning. Take a look at this chart below. What we saw in the last week was a market rally that broke above former ATH (all time highs) established back in January of 2018. You can even see that the market first rejected breaking over the ATH on August 21, 2018 and it wasn’t until Friday August 24 and Monday August 27th that they juiced the market up and over on huge thrust.

[https://imgur.com/a/090IlNr](https://imgur.com/a/090IlNr)

What we have now is price performing a throwback to the resistance (i.e., the ATH) to test for latent supply. The test here is pretty much successful and we should see a reversal up. The second bullish reason is that we have a falling/descending wedge in an uptrend – these patterns tend to break to the upside. Take a look at this next chart to see this descending wedge in all its glory.

[https://imgur.com/a/WkLYqOV](https://imgur.com/a/WkLYqOV)

For the third bullish reason, take a look at the daily candles on the S&P500. Notice the large candle body wicks – the wicks are >= half the candle body. This tells me that smart money was absorbing the selling and that the majority of the selling was trapped late bulls and profit takers. In other words, there is no conviction from the bears here.

[https://imgur.com/a/WTmvIdt](https://imgur.com/a/WTmvIdt)

&#x200B;

**Russel 2000**

The Russel 2000 has been a very strong index and at at times rally front runner. It has the same bullish reasoning behind it as the S&P500 – that is, ATH retest and absorbtion of the selling. The one difference is that in the shorter time frame (hourly – daily), price is in a downtrending channel. Expect it to break to the upside and again go long once the channel resistance is retested as support (see the second Russel 2000 chart for that trade plan).

&#x200B;

**DJIA**

I won’t spend much time on this one expect to say that this index did not even budge and has pretty much shaken on this recession. Bearishly though, it does indeed have yet to test and break its ATH from January of 2018.

[https://imgur.com/a/Lvc0avm](https://imgur.com/a/Lvc0avm)

&#x200B;

**TLDR**

Indices look bullish, the recession was profit taking and not actually proof of bearish conviction. Expect a strong but possibly short lived rally (i.e, dead cat bounce) on Monday cause I am.

&#x200B;

**Monday Sep 9 Update**

I took a bit of a dicking this morning got caught in that sell off but recovered my losses.

Here is an update on the S&P 500 - descending wedge broke to the upside, price is now back to the breakout area for a retest before the real rally up.

[https://imgur.com/a/rSCHjeh](https://imgur.com/a/rSCHjeh)

Here is the Nasdaq 100 - we can see that the sell off reversed right on the resistance line. This was a throwback retest and it appears to have held. I made the mistake of front running the retest by going long and was underwater for a bit. We may still get one more test, but this line is now support and should be providing some easy RR long trades/bounces.

[https://imgur.com/a/DHqzFZi](https://imgur.com/a/DHqzFZi)

Intraday wise, /NQ is in a bit of a precarious spot could rally or could tank hard here. I will wait for another sell off / retest before going long.

&#x200B;

**Tuesday Sep 10 Update around 2 pm EST**

S&P500 made antother retest of the descending wedge and launched a really powerful rally. Take a look below. If the S&P500 does sell off, I expect the covering to happen where those black arrows are.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nf15awosgnl11.png?width=1338&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d1268c7309b9eb0d521676df918665505ff206c

**Nasdaq 100**

Pennant break to the upside, led to massive rally. Look how it found resistance right on the former channel break down. Price will probably retest the pennant resistance turned support before giving way to another rally.

Notice how they broke the pennant down before market open and then immediately reversed it up? **That is how big rallies are launched, by fakeouts - think of it like judo, using trapped bears' momentum against them!**

https://preview.redd.it/3uckyupnenl11.png?width=1169&format=png&auto=webp&s=352f54718f3b99099de0fde41410c03ca187f014

&#x200B;

Here is the channel I was talking about. Notice how price is tapping on that support? That is where I went short earlier today for a quick scalp.

https://preview.redd.it/7tfypl53fnl11.png?width=1340&format=png&auto=webp&s=2782e21575497882ab389a7ac92a8c5767b33321

&#x200B;

I missed the easy rally this morning cause I was late so I didn't want to chase, hence why I waited to short at resistance instead. Proof below.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Russell 2000**

Here is the Russell 2000 - notice again, we have the same type of retest on the breakout. Price found support and will probably push up from here on the channel resistance turned support. The black arrows are from the original post from the weekend and have not been changed.

&#x200B;

However, this is a perfect technical setup and I'll explain why.

&#x200B;

**Chart One**

[https://imgur.com/a/QJJfE0N](https://imgur.com/a/QJJfE0N)

* Take a look to see how daily price reacts when price breaches below the lower bollinger band. Notice how price rips back up hard? Look at where price is at now.
* Price is just hovering on channel support

&#x200B;

**Chart Two**

[https://i.imgur.com/dA7ufHm.png](https://i.imgur.com/dA7ufHm.png)

Looking at volume nodes, we can see that there is huge volume transactions taking place at slightly below the current price level, around $43 - $42.5. If I was a big size shorter, I would look to cover inside this volume node so that I could mask my exit without pushing price up too high against me as I unwind my position.

&#x200B;

**Trade Plan**

Start going long, accumulate shares/calls here. I myself grabbed some SEP14 50 calls and kept five into this week. I got them on market open last Friday for 0.16 and they went up to 0.28 by 9:35 am and hovered there until 10 am. I will be looking to load more of them.

Here is my position and the option price chart from this Friday.

[https://imgur.com/a/b6Hvmdm](https://imgur.com/a/b6Hvmdm)

&#x200B;

Here is what I expect price to do - I anticipate that there is one more good flush sell left in MU before the recovery/trend reversal takes place.

&#x200B;

**The record trade surplus will just provide more fodder for the Trump Administration** to ramp up tariffs further. Not that they need more of an excuse.  
 

**But there is a plenty of irony here,** because it is the way these tariffs are being rolled out that is actually driving the current massive surplus.  
 

**Recall that the next USD 200 billion worth of tariffs can be applied any day now** – and Trump just reiterated his threat to add another USD 267 billion more on Friday.  
 

**The result:** Trump’s actions are driving the dollar  stronger and incentivizing American buyers to bring import purchases  forward in time – to beat the next round of tariffs.  
 

The timing element will all change, of course, once the full complement  of tariffs are in place; but as long as there is the threat of more to  come, the incentive will be for Americans to purchase MORE Chinese  goods.  
 

**Get smart:** The negative effects of the trade war still  aren’t showing up in the data, but they will soon. Purchases that were  brought forward into Q3 will be purchases forgone in Q4 – expect very  weak Chinese export data to close out the year.

At first glance this might appear to be good for intel (more demand), however the real reason for the lack of capacity is they were depending on their huge $12 Billion 10nm Fab to produce CPUs, which so far produces nothing useful whatsoever.  If 10nm was working right they would have plenty of capacity to meet demand.

It will be interesting to see how these TSMC 16nm Coffee Lake chips perform relative to their intel 14nm counterparts. I have my doubts that intel would pay TSMC to fab these chips because my impression is that TSMC 16nm has some interesting advantages over Intel 14nm (less leakage, better power characteristics).

This stock has a lower PE than MU and a slightly less shitty outlook.

Recent separation from MetLife has created increases operating and hedging expenses but a lot of that should go down over the next 6-18 months. Basically just costs a lot of money to recreate all the operating and hedging stuff under a new company. The company is new but the business is old and undervalued by any and every metric. It's not a sure thing they turn it around this quarter and long-term growth is doubtful but the assets they hold are currently worth 25% more than the current stock price so there is limited downside risk.

I’m long MU, just shares. I think the margins are going to be squeezed much less than expected. Can anyone counter the argument that they’re selling higher value dram (illustrated by the increase in asp last quarter while dram asp decreased overall) is decommocizing the market?

I’m genuinely curious if anyone can explain, or has approximated the threshold of dram prices where higher end solutions will be less cost effective if the price of the lower value solutions hits a certain point?

The EPS Estimate is probably based on the cycle nature of movie theaters and is looking at an overall general trend of all theaters.

What the EPS estimate isn't seeing 

AMC A - LIST membership

As of July 31 (read fucking over a month ago) the company updates that its Stubs A-List program has more than 175K members enrolled.

How it works

You pay a monthly amount and get to see 3 movies a week, plus you get points on buying concessions AND when you PAY for a friends ticket through the app. (only at amc theaters)

Now just within the first 1,000,000 seats taken using this app 30% of them were paid for (ie someone paying for a friend to come with them).

Now you're asking 

""lol moviepass""

you would normally be right, but AMC owns the theaters. Where they make their money is when those users buy concessions, popcorn, chips, candy, soda; it's pure profit and those users GET POINTS11.

I'm going to guess they do a nice hard surprise on earnings, because 1 they've always been underestimated and 2 AMC a List. shit should trade slightly up until earnings hell maybe even sideways then it will moon",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9ezob5/amc_entertainment_dd/,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9ezob5/amc_entertainment_dd/

exchange-traded fund fund",WSB Meme Stock ETF,"What type of barriers would there be for creating a functional WSB Meme stock ETF?

&#x200B;

Found an article with some questions about starting an ETF  after the initial post.

**Outthink the competition**. You can bet that a lot of other investment managers are considering launching an ETF just like you are. In order to stand out in the crowd, you need to outthink the competition, pounce on any opportunity and be nimble enough to adapt your strategy.

***The finest of Curated Meme Stocks***

&#x200B;

**Find a niche.** With thousands of other ETFs out there, you need to create a fund that’s unique or meets an unmet need. So make sure you understand the ETF landscape, including what your competitors are doing, what works and what doesn’t.

***Cater to the Most Autistic of investors that cant do their own DD***

&#x200B;

**Connect with investors.** It’s critical that investors understand your fund and its investment strategy. If you can’t explain it in an elevator pitch, it needs more work.

***Run by retards for retards***

&#x200B;

**Assess your costs.** Figure out a realistic picture of the cost of launching and maintaining the ETF for the first 18 months. Also think about the amount and timing of seed capital to show activity and not put everything up front.

***Costs dont Exist if we make it rain tendies.***

&#x200B;

**Make it tax efficient:** One of the key selling points of an ETF is that it minimizes the tax burden on investors. So it’s important that the fund have the right structure and management for handling gains, losses and distributions.

***If you have to pay taxes at the end of this you fuckers should be happy***

&#x200B;

**Get good distribution.** If you don’t have a good way of getting your ETF in front of investors, it won’t matter how good your fund or investment strategy is. So get the attention of broker-dealers and establish credibility by building up performance and market share.

***Who needs a to suck an investors dick when we have this audience here***

&#x200B;

**Start off strong.** Lock down your investment strategy, sales and distribution before you launch. Once the ETF is trading, give yourself about 18 months to make sales self-sustaining. Set a goal of $100 million in assets under management for the first year.

***Im sure we have enough capital in this Subreddit to Secure ""Funding""***

&#x200B;

**Pick a service provider.** Creating and running an ETF is far from simple. So make sure you get someone highly skilled and experienced to handle technology and operations. Most ETFs outsource these functions, but you have to pick the right one.

***Pick them like we pick a stock got it***

&#x200B;

**Court financial advisers.** Even if your ETF is outperforming the market, you should nurture relations with financial advisers. That will help raise the profile and sales of your fund.

***Save money by not doing this and pass those savings on to you***

&#x200B;

**Regulation and compliance:** Don’t forget the regulators. Make sure you understand all the regulatory requirements and that your platform and reporting are in compliance.

***Eh...***

2. Stock tends to run up in the fall/winter due to the Victoria secret fashion show.
3. Victoria secret will unveil its new lingerie/pajama's during the fall/winter which increases sales.
4. I know the past doesn't represent the future, but look at last year when VS began to run up around the start September.

I purchased $1000 worth of  lotto calls 42.5 strike expiring January to play with this idea. Might purchase more if Victoria secret continues to rally.

On any ""call observation date"", if the stock is above the initial price, the note autocalls (redeems early with no future payments).

On each ""coupon observation date"" until autocall or final valuation date (whichever is earlier), if the underlying is above the coupon barrier, you receive the coupon amount (which obviously is significantly higher than interest rates).

If the note hasn't autocalled, at maturity: if the stock is above the downside threshold, you will receive your full notional. if below, you will only receive final price / initial price times the notional.

This is definitely not a low risk product. Your entire capital is at risk and you could, in theory, lose your entire investment if the stock goes to zero or if the issuer defaults. These are designed to perform in flattish / slightly upward-drifting markets.

1. Why not just buy the stock straight out, collect dividend along the way, less risk, and gain the supposed upside?

2. Just because they are a monopoly, doesn't make them automatically have sales growth. They had more than 4B less revenue in 2017 versus 2014, and they are on track to basically match their 2017 sales level. Stock has been basically sideways for 5 years and revenue estimates for 2019 don't look any better.

The lawsuit resolution doesn't help QCOM if they don't get better pricing to up their sales, and unless you have some inside info that tells me/us that that is what will happen, I don't see a driver for revenue growth, and therefore don't see the same opportunity in share price appreciation.",Buy QCOM Leaps 2020 (DD inside).,"[My last DD on AVGO](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9blptm/buy_avgo_calls_jan_or_anything_further_out/) went well, but I was also dumb enough to dump most of [my RH play money into MU Jan 50c's](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9eyty7/mu_literal_hindu_prayer_thread/) so take whatever I am saying with a metric ton of salt.

QCOM is basically a tech monopoly, but our politicians are too dumb to understand how email works let alone wireless technologies. 

QCOM is very unique in that they are the worlds most successful patent licensing firm and a semi con. QCOM has two distinct Business units that account for most of their revenues. QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) which sells most of the chips (think snapdragon etc.) and QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) which is the BU that rakes in all the licensing dollars.

&#x200B;

QCOM has been sued by everyone and their mom (Apple being the biggest one) for predatory pricing and monopolistic practices with regards to the royalty payments made to QTL. **Any resolution in these lawsuit is in fact a net positive for Qualcomm, particularly the Apple lawsuit .** The reason I say this is that Qualcomm and Apple share a codependent love hate relationship and the lawsuit has basically become a [negotiation for future pricing.](https://9to5mac.com/2018/05/01/qualcomm-apple-resolution-offer/)

&#x200B;

QTL is a money printing juggernaut, **it doesnt matter whether or not you use QCOM chips on your wireless device**, you still have to pay the license fees. 

&#x200B;

QCOMs Snapdragon is the best Android processor out there (Apple makes their own.). QCOMs RF and WiFi chipsets are amongst the best in the industry. (Apple used Intel modems and there is a rumor that they might make their own in 2020.)

&#x200B;

QCOM is using this industry leadership to branch of and dominate niche markets like wearables and quick charge. Their IoT and automotive strategy took a bit of a hit with the failed acquisition of NXP, but they havent given up on those markets. 

&#x200B;

On the wireless landscape there are a bunch of new technologies that will be hitting the market next year and Qualcomm is an outright market leader in many of these.

&#x200B;

**WiFi -** 802.11 ax, only real competition is Broadcom (MRVL, Mediatek and Intel are stinking turds.)and they havent been able to figure out [key parts of the spec](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-battle-for-next-gen-wi-fi-pits-qualcomm-against-broadcom-2018-09-10). This tech is slated to start hitting enterprise end of this year and consumer markets by mid to late 2019 (phones).

&#x200B;

**5G:-** Rolling out soon, testbeds are being scaled up, mass adoption is projected in 2020. 

&#x200B;

TLDR:  Keep looking at QCOM leaps, end of Apple lawsuit is fundamentally good for QCOM, Trade War is the biggest storm cloud (sorry for using this). Watch for an immediate tank in the stock price from any trade or lawsuit news.  

Again this isnt a FD play strictly long term. 

I dont really know how to do TA voodoo but I think anything below 65 is a steal for QCOM. I would buy leaps if it hit between 65 - 68.

Apple stated they planned to get rid of their “Touch ID” option in their newer phones. This benefits Lumentum a lot, mainly because their involved with the face recognition feature on the iPhone, which deals with 3D sensing. I don’t know how the market will react to it, but it would be a better play for long calls. Phones that use face recognition are supposed to double in the next two years, mainly because many androids haven’t added the feature yet.

To keep it brief it discloses that Robinhood sells its customers orders to HFTs like Citadel. Not only that but the HFTs are willing to pay **10 TIMES** what other brokers sell their customer orders for. 

Just as a side note, IBKR and Vanguard do not sell their customer orders while Etrade, TD Ameritrade and Schwab do.

Now why are HFTs paying this much for Robinhood data? Is it because its dumb money, do they know that investors in Robinhood are usually less experienced and will chase options and stocks? I believe the answer is yes. Just look at Chinese IPOs or current pot stock mania but if you look into it the data is quite useful for the average trader/investor

I looked up the top 10 held Robinhood stocks on May 25th, 2018 and examined their performance until today, September 11th, 2018. Just a quick note all calculations are back of the envelope:

1. AMD . +110%
2. AAPL . +20%
3. F . -19%
4. GE . -15%
5. FB . -13%
6. GPRO . +14%
7. MSFT . +8%
8. FIT . +16%
9. SNAP . -2%
10. BAC . +6%

If you equal weighted these names in a portfolio over the past 3 months you would be up 125%. Now a lot of that outperformance is solely due to AMD so lets remove it. You still end up with a portfolio that would be up 15% doubling the performance of the S&P 500 over that time frame.

The more important takeaway imo because this is WSB is that you can see these were all high beta names w/ the exception of a couple so there were plenty of entry and exit points were one could have done even better (or worse) utilizing options or common. I don't have an exact strategy to build around this yet but I fins it an intriguing data set and one I plan to build on.

I have been learning about new technical indicators over the past couple of days, and one in particular I've learned about is the ""odd lot"" indicator. Basically, it keeps track of non-100 increment stock orders and spits out an indicator based on the buying/selling action.

The theory behind the indicator is that, because the average retail investor loses money, and because retail investors are predominantly the ones who would buy/sell in non 100-stock increments (unlike mutual funds or institutions), you should inverse the retail investor trends. 

Does anyone here know of any websites or tools that they can use to find this indicator on stocks in real time?

will chug an oktoberfest in your honor.",($SAM) Let's talk about booze.,"Alright, fuckers. I posted a bit ago on the ""the stock market is crashing omg hold cash and ally savings accounts"" subreddits about this, but wanted to toss some DD towards everyone else about a sector that I'm sure most of us are not in: booze.    

There are a few players overall in the space, but overall after checking out the major players, earlier this year I ended up landing on $SAM.   

**Finances:**    

- They're sitting on ~$76m in cash, which is important for a point later here.   

- Missed EPS estimates last quarter, mostly due to an increase in OpEx.

- Rev stream still looks to be growing + be fine overall.    

- P/E higher than the dumbshit Craft Brewer's Alliance, but is literally 1/2 of Anheuser Busch.     
    

**Bullish indicators:**    

- New CEO: Dave Burwick (formerly of Peet's Coffee) took the reins earlier this year and is running the shop there currently. Burwick previously had a history with Peet's for acquiring smaller companies to add to the Peet's brand overall, which helped their company significantly. With their cash on hand + Burwick joining the team, I'm very much expecting $SAM to start branching even further and start working on becoming a solid ""umbrella"" for multiple brands. They've already acquired a few companies + have developed a few in-house to capitalize on some specific markets.     

- New Markets: $SAM owns Angry Orchard (doing great, but not my focus here) and Truly Hard Seltzer. As far as short term plays go, this is where the money is on this one. $SAM has admitted that their actual beer brand itself has been suffering overall... but has been offset significantly by the Angry Orchard + Truly Brands. With it being summer, we've seen a significant increase in purchases + interest of hard seltzer overall, and with $SAM's distribution ring they're pretty much on every shelf that sells it.  This is a huge market as far as the booze industry goes that's literally just developing and Truly is towards the top as far as primary brands go.    

- Depletions: Usually something you only worry about with mining companies, $SAM has had insanely significant increases in their depletions (how long beer sits in their facilities before it's sent to a distributor). This was a big issue last year when they were apparently fucking around and not giving a shit about it, but we're looking at a depletion rate ~11% better than the same quarter last year. This is huge.    

- Sponsorships: One of the reasons I'm suspecting that OpEx increased last quarter significantly was due to the new sponsorship of the Boston Red Sox. Remember the Budweiser shit in the back of Fenway? Yeah, that's fucking gone and is now Sam Adams until at least 2028. They also run the show as far as pushing their brands in the stadium itself.    

- Investing in ""competitors"": Boston Beer offers investments + coaching for smaller breweries, which they pull profit long-term on. Huge for the industry but also great as far as profit goes for the company itself. Win/win.    

- Year's worth of supplies: These fuckers literally could stop getting the supplies to brew their beer and could make more for about a year. Literally insanity but it's awesome and they also did the industry itself a solid by selling hops to smaller breweries at market price from their reserves when there was a market shortage.

**Questionable indicators:**    

- CMO leaving: This could be good or bad. Basically the CMO fucked off who made the ""Fill your glass"" marketing campaign for them. Hopefully they'll grab someone who can be better than that campaign.   

- This OpEx bullshit: literally did not see it coming last quarter so I'm hoping they have it figured out this time around.    

**Bearish things:**    
- AB + other big macros are trying to expand: tons of competition in identifying good buys as far as smaller breweries go, and it's tough to compete with the capital AB has. That said, ideally from a product perspective $SAM can have leverage here on keeping shit not god awful.    

**Conclusion:   **

$SAM is insanely undervalued and I expect some firms that currently have stakes to continue increasing them, as it will continue to trend up. Buy the fuck in and ride up on a lower volume/volatility stock to balance out your MU $90 calls.    

**Disclaimer:**    

I'm long $SAM via a large position + am leveraging with call options.    

Also I'm drunk on Oktoberfest right now.

This is why there's no support to the stock price right now. The whales know it. The hedge funds know it. Most of you don't. This is direct manipulation to add shares for cheap. However, they got most of you based on the posts of people bailing out after a ""60% loss.""

It's clear that the entire semi sector is being discounted (a stock screener and rank I run has MU, LRCX, AMAT, and ON in the top 10). However memory pricing isn't a death knell for semis, even if it is treated that way.

Micron can make up on any potential memory pricing drops (and have been and expect to) through increases in margins, sales mix, volume, and ASP. 

**Per BofA ML:**

> We believe the recent share-price correction is mostly based on concerns of a downturn.
> Our research indicates record-high revenue/profit. True, memory chip prices are no
> longer rising, but this does not mean a downturn as cost cuts and sales volume increase.
> We still model FY19-20 EPS at $10-11, which implies only 4-5x P/E and 3x EV/EBITDA.
> Our $100 PO is derived from a 2.5x P/B (historical average 1-2x) due to high ROE (fair
> P/E only 10x), and supported by DCF (8% WACC, FCF yield over 10% for the long term).

**Per JP Morgan**

> Longer term, the company’s increasing product (DRAM, NAND, NOR) and
> end-market diversification should dampen revenue/earnings volatility and
> also position the company to do well in markets (handset) that require
> multiple types of memory.

• Micron should benefit from secular trends in mobile DRAM that should help
it reduce volatility to commodity DRAM. Post the Elpida acquisition, we
believe Micron will be positioned well to benefit from secular trends in
mobility, networking, and cloud computing.

• New technology, divestiture of non-core assets, and cost-cutting efforts
should help it improve gross margins and profitability in the coming quarters.
Valuation

> Our Dec 2018 price target of $84 assumes that Micron should trade at ~10x (in
> line with the memory peer group average over the past several years) mid-cycle
> earnings power of ~$8.40. We believe memory fundamentals remain solid in the
> midterm, and management’s focus on improving margin profiles across business
> segments (particularly in its NAND segment) should drive better profitability.
> Above-average upside potential from current levels drives our Overweight
> rating.

Another point, per u/cyphr0n

> By SEC rule, a company cannot buy back its shares for a 5 week period which ends 2 days after the ER. This is why even though the buy period has begun in September, there are no buy backs yet.

o Over the last few months, I believe I have finally figured out how to swing trade stocks using fundamentals (most importantly), technicals (for entries and exits), and indicators to show me more data on that stock (remember though, price action > indicators, so let the market do the talking).

o So lets break this down, when I first started I tried using all sorts of MAs, EMAs, VWAP, Bollinger Bands, ETC. but for ME, I find that these indicators made my chart too crowded and therefore over-complicating the issue. I try to think like “big money” now. If you can imagine that in your account you were responsible for 100 million dollars, you would want to invest in “good” or fundamentally solid companies. So why think any differently about your measly robinhood account if the goal is to make money?

**Strategy**

o First and foremost, any company that I want to trade/invest in, go to their website (I really only play “good stocks)! See what the offer, see if they are a leader or an innovator, or whatever their “thing” may be, look around on the website to get a better understanding of the company and what they do.

o Second, I got to yahoo finance and just check over their fundamentals (on the sheets that I had posted previously, use that as a guide). So I want to see good y/y growth, q/q growth, increased gross revenue, good ROA/ROE/ROI, stuff like that. Information that shows that a company is financially healthy and can continue its success.

o By the way some examples of “good” companies that I invest/trade/follow are: SHOP ATVI AAXN ROKU SEND TEAM TMUS etc. Typically mid-large caps, anywhere from 20-250$ or so. I try to stay away from speculative plays, biotech, and pennies. Obviously you can make good money trading all three, but for me, it isn’t appealing.

o Third, plot out the technicals (support/resistance/mental stop/PT) so that you have a PLAN. If you make a plan, write it down, you are doing it objectively. After that, stick to the plan and don’t get emotional over the trade. Let your winners ride, cut the losers quick (2à1 ratio), and don’t over think it!

o Fourth, when plotting these technicals, I **ONLY** look at the daily charts; to me the intra-day stuff isn’t important. Most of us are busy and cant pay attention to the intra-day stuff anyways. If you want, just set alerts on your TOS or whatever app you like about a stock, and get a notification if it crosses a

certain threshold. Again, you can use different times frames, but for me this

is what works.  
o On the daily time frame, the ONLY indicators I use are 26MA (roughly a

month), 50MA (big $$ indicator), 65MA, 200MA (big $$ indicator).  
o Fifth, when looking at my chats, im trying to find “good” stocks that are either

about to breakout (ROKU AMD TEAM), and you can “see it.” The patterns are very similar, and when you couple that with good fundamentals, you have a very good chance of making good money. Here are a couple examples of what the “set up” looks like.

o Do you notice how these stocks (AMD TEAM ROKU), have all followed a nice trend up? So remember, the trend is your friend, and if you have good fundamentals on a company, you can add to an over-reaction (for example NKE and Kaepernick).

o Quick example of WHY YOU NEEEEEEEEEED fundamentals for a stock to continue moving higher. Lets look at ATVI which finally completed the Cup and Handle.

o Notice the Cup and Handle and then the breakout after, so technically speaking, that is a textbook example of a cup and handle, BUT it only happened because of NEWS with ATVI. They had an upgrade yesterday, which was the CATALYST to that technical pattern. So playing technicals ONLY can get you in trouble that is why it is extremely important to couple your technicals with FUNDAMENTALS. If you need more references, look back at other sheets I have posted, or just use Google/YouTube/etc. to understand more about technicals. The internet is a powerful tool for investors, use it!

**Key Points**

o Keep it simple.  
o Think like a whale.  
o Visit the companies website.  
o Use fundamentals as your base and technicals as your entry/exit.o Don’t solely rely on technicals, use them as a tool.

**CSE Ticker** - CWEB.CN
**US OTC Ticket** - CWBHF

IPO Quietly raised $101 million + after being actively traded 2 weeks later - Another $13.5 million 

The farm bill is setup to pass and remove Hemp as a criminalized plant. This hasn't been legal for massive production and manufacturing for farmers since WW2 (Hemp for War campaign). The bill passes the House and Senate did not pass it. They're now going through and consolidating both bill and signing end of September. This will be huge for the Hemp sector, and reviewing CWEBs prospectus, recent private placements, they're setting themselves up to produce and manufacture Hemp for their CBD oils and many other product lines. Keeping a close eye on this stock play, as they're #1 in the CBD sector. The MJ sector has been a hot one, CBD is just starting.

Basically we have a company with quarterly sales of $17M, $1M Debt, and sitting on $250-$400M cash.
With a valuation of $1.4B or 1/6th TLRY. Additionally, low share float and solid financials is what's driving the demand. Think TLRY but with exponentially better financials. Also, CWEB releases ER today

**Upcoming catalysts:**

* ER Released EOD
* Farm Bill passing with Hemp clause end of September
* US markets OTC open October 10
* MJ bill October in Canada



**Additional notes:**

* CVSI (arguably $Cwebs main competitor) is now underwater due to securities fraud (lied about patent filing to Shareholders). Shady management, dealings, and just in general a sketch company.

There are about 10 D&Bs though. ",Puts on $PLAY for earnings on Friday morning.,"So I’ve sworn off earnings plays for a while, but if I was a degenerate fuckhead, I’d be looking at puts on $PLAY for this Friday’s earnings.

Main reasoning being that $PLAY (Dave & Buster’s) derives a lot of business from “corporate outings”. For those of you that don’t work with the washed masses in the corporate business world, these are generally departmental outings where everyone goes out during the afternoon to blow off some steam and see if they can land their very own #metoo moment over by the machine you drop tokens into hoping to push other tokens off the magnetically protected cliff. It’s a good catch all place where everyone can eat and generally have a decent time away from the office.

But if some of you recall from a few weeks back, $ELY earnings plays were being hyped simply due to the fact they hold a ownership stake in Top Golf. Rightly so, their ER was strong and the stock had a nice pop. 

I don’t know what some of you may have observed, but these things are raping and pillaging the corporate outings customer base. Top Golf has been popping up in major cities left and right and they are always PACKED. I’ve got to think this is pulling business away from $PLAY, and I’m curios to see if they mention lowered guidance, revenues, or even just cop to the fact they are facing increased competition.

Anyways, do what you will with this info. 

TLDR; Top Golf is stealing the corporate outing/event crowd from Dave & Busters. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9fcv03/puts_on_play_for_earnings_on_friday_morning/,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9fcv03/puts_on_play_for_earnings_on_friday_morning/

* **Introductory Ramblings**

As for $PTLA, I wrote [a thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8gwc3h/ptla_fda_approval_what_you_need_to_know_and_what/) here about approval of Andexxa. Even though I was correct, the play was not profitable if you held up until now. I personally believe that $PTLA is *heavily* undervalued and that buying into it right now holds very little risk when looking at it from a 12-month perspective. I have no price target for this play but I do have two potential price catalysts for the following 12 months. I have never given a 12-month prediction on here before because my plays are much shorter in general. I expect this play to be shorter than 12 months, but I am confident in it enough that I will hold and average down for an entire 12 months - if necessary. 

On another note, what spurred me to write this thread was Portola's graph today. Portola seems to have a heavy floor of $29/share today due to someone, or some entity, with a large limit-buy of $29/share. Whether this holds is beyond the point because times like these are always very interesting to me. Some one or some group out there is confident enough to create their own resistance. Now, it could be due to another reason, such as market makers pinning the price so options remain worthless. Options volume isn't strong enough for that in my opinion. Whatever the reason, and I know I'm rambling here, I found today's graph interesting and it convinced me to finally write this post. I've been wanting to write something on Portola for months now.

* **Lengthy Background. Skip if you want.**

Portola's current troubles are not unlike Omeros' ($OMER) initial, unfortunate troubles with management and marketing. Although I will say that as far as bad management goes, Portola is much worse than Omeros' management used to be. On the other end of this stick, Portola's pipeline is magnitudes stronger than Omeros' pipeline. 

I will eventually write a longer article on this topic and about pharmaceuticals in general. The gist of it is that, while bad management can drive down stock price in the short-term, and is something to look out for when heading into FDA approvals -- due to badly written or performed studies, among other things -- a strong drug will remain a strong drug. And no company, no matter how horrible their management is, will be able to hold onto a multi billion-dollar drug and let it go to waste. Make no mistake, Andexxa can and will, either under Portola or another pharmaceutical company, generate net revenue well into the billions. 

I personally am of the belief that a well-marketed and produced Andexxa alone would have been worth over 4 billion dollars had it been approved and produced during its first PDUFA. Portola has wasted 2 years of patent time on Andexxa, but that's no matter. It will still net billions. 

-

The reason Portola dropped is because they had a loss of 106.2M in their most recently reported quarter. On top of this, their drugs were massively under-marketed. The most worrisome was Bevyxxa's revenue. Andexxa we knew was going to be low due to Portola's inferior production capabilities and [self-imposed restrictions.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8gwc3h/ptla_fda_approval_what_you_need_to_know_and_what/dyftjin/) Regarding Portola's unusual decision in limiting sales of Andexxa, some theorize that Portola is pushing for better treatment results to leverage a buyout offer, though I am on the fence about such a theory. I am neither completely sold nor disagreeing. I will explain more another time. 

Bevyxxa's revenue being low points to a marketing team that is not ready, at all, to pitch sales to hospitals around the country. I say this a lot, but I will save longer explanation for when I write a longer article. I need to speak with a lawyer in half an hour, so I don't have much time here. Bevyxxa, not nearly as valuable as Andexxa, is a good drug worth a lot of money (I won't give it my own price target like I did for Andexxa). Its success hinges on Portola being able to convince hospitals to restructure the way they care for patients. This requires more effort than simply saying, hey, our drug is good. It takes a talented marketing team, whereas something like Andexxa would sell itself. 

When Portola reported a disappointing quarter, it cast into doubt their ability to market a complicated drug like Bevyxxa in the first place. Holding this concern and labeling it an unfortunate eventuality still does not, in my opinion, justify Portola's drop to such a low valuation of sub 2 billion dollars. Portola may be bad, but they cannot hold onto these two drugs forever and waste their potential. They are a publicly traded company and eventually the hammer will come down. It's just politics. 

Now, *when* that hammer comes down is another argument, but it will. And I highly doubt it would take more than 6 months. 

-

-

* **The Potential Catalysts**

The biggest potential catalyst is a buyout, and while I believe it's very possible for Portola, I do think that management are far too stuck up their asses to do it just yet. Once a company makes bad decision after bad decision, investors will stop giving them the benefit of the doubt. Portola is in this position right now. Giving them the benefit of the doubt, Portola needed approval of Andexxa first before they could consider selling themselves. They also need approval of their recently submitted PAS, which has a decision date by the end of this calendar year. 

This leads me into the next catalyst, which is approval of the PAS. This would open up Portola to mass-produce Andexxa and market it around the entire country. They would be able to do so the very next day. This alone is such a huge catalyst that it cannot be understated. Investors don't entirely believe it will be successful. This however doesn't matter to me because, if it's not successful, Portola will be forced to sell themselves to another company. These two catalysts are tied because I believe my prior theory to be unavoidable. Portola will not be able to justify wasting another year of Andexxa's patent life on a fourth failed approval attempt, and they will have to sell to a larger pharmaceutical company that can effectively tackle production and marketing.

If PAS does gain approval, not only will share price increase, potential for a larger buyout offer goes through the roof. However... I think Portola's management is misguided enough to think that they can market and produce their drugs effectively and make more money without going for a buyout. I don't know their internal revenue estimates or what buyout offers they've been receiving, but outside investors can only stare from the outside within and hypothesize that a buyout is off the table if Portola can generate positive EPS and keep up with production. 

Regardless of their mystic inner workings, I think a buyout is unlikely only because of how many bad decisions Portola has made thus far. I would not put it past them to make another bad decision. I could be off the mark and giving Portola's management a hard time, which I admittedly always have, but I need to see at least approval of PAS before I will change my mind on this. 

There are other catalysts, but these are the most pivotal.

* **The Plays**

Basically I'm long on shares and I have tons of 2019 calls. I'm not leveraged in the margin-sense. I just have a lot of OTM calls for pretty much everything in 2019. I have strikes ranging from $35/share to $90/share. I bought and sold my $30 and $35 strike calls for a nice profit because I, by chance, timed the drop and rise from $25/share to over $28/share really well. 

I have no price target for this play because the price target can vary from $50/share with approval of PAS to over $100/share with a buyout. Depending on the catalyst, Portola's share price is not predictable, which is why I have so many different calls at different strikes. I also have shares in case my timing is completely wrong and my options expire worthless. 

This play, if you buy options, is incredibly risky. As are most of my plays involving options. You can buy and hold shares for significantly less risk, as long as your horizon is 12 months, but that is of course my humble opinion. Me being confident in this play does not mean you should automatically be equally as confident.

Turkcell is simultaneously partnering with western app makers to offer consumer CHOICE. Another plank is the focus on data as a national resource not the property of western firms.

I am also long on it.",Shotspotter ($SSTI) DD,"Full disclosure: I have a long position in this stock at an average cos of 51.37. This stock as near it's 52 week high, so if you are not a long buyer, be weary of a pullback. Please do your own DD.

Just wanted to present some information about a stock that i've been following for a few weeks now. It's still pretty under the radar with low volume.

SSTI is a company that produces detectors that detect gun fire and informs police of the location through triangulation in as little as 30 seconds. Apparently, this is useful, because in areas of high gun violence, people tend to become desensitized to it and police often don't get called.

The first question I had was, how can this tech discriminate between a gun shot and something similar sounding, like a firework. So, I learned that the captured sounds are routed to their headquarters where they have an experienced team that listens to the sounds and helps distinguish between a gun shot and other similar sounding sounds.

So, they are able to detect the gun shots, does this actually make a difference? I found a lot of firsthand anecdotal evidence from people that lived in cities that have this tech present. Some people said it worked and police were able to get evidence much more quickly, while others said police showed up, and even though it happened quickly, it still didn't make a difference as they couldn't find shell casings and the perpetrators had already fled. However, recently, the city of Chicago renewed shotspotter to a 3 year/23 million dollar contract, and stated that it helped lower gun violence by a 43% total. The Chicago police superintendent even said that this technology was the biggest fact in reducing gun violence and that it was a game changer. This figure still seems unbelievable to me, but honestly it doesn't even matter. The fact of the matter is is that gun violence is not gonna decrease anytime soon. They are never going to institute any gun control measures. But, as these events become more and more publicized, governments and police forces are going to need to look like they're trying to combat the problem, and this is the exact type of tech they're going to spend money on to at least make it seem like they care. The contract extension does give me belief that the product is legit though.

With this in mind, there is a lot of room for expansion. They are in about 90ish cities right now with plans to expand to 140+ in the coming year. So how are they expanding? Previously, they had a partnership with Verizon to be packaged in security suite of products that Verizon would advertise through their brand. Recently, Verizon decided to allow Shotspotter to be sold as a stand alone product. Why does this matter? Previously, if people didn't want to buy the entire suite, they didn't have the option to buy shotspotter alone, but now they can and that should increase sales. There can also be expansion that occurs within the cities they are already located in. For example, after initial testing, Chicago decided to expand Shotspotter into a bigger area, which obviously means more revenue for SSTI.

So, there is a lot of room for growth imo. In terms of financials, the stock is near its 52 week high. I hesitated to post this now, because I know people tend to see hype on a stock and then jump in, but there is a possibility this could see a short term pullback, so please do your own DD. If you are long though, I think any time is a good time to get in. The market cap is only at 650Million, and if we extrapolate the chicago contract out to other cities, it becomes obvious that there is a lot of room for growth. The company increased 52% in revenue from Q1 to Q2 and they were on the cusp of being profitable. Again, please do your own DD and feel free to as any questions

NIO is basically the chinese answer to Tesla. The company itself is very ambitious and has a strong line up of electric vehicles coming and plans for a smart/electric home. The company launched on the NYSE on 9/12/18 @ around $6.64 and on 9/13/18 it saw a huge upswing in growth by around +75% during market hours and +15% in after hours for a new price of $13.50 in only a single day! The stock appears to not show any signs of slowing down any time soon. NIO's website is [http://nio.io/](http://nio.io/) if you're curious to learn more about the company. It appears they claim to have the worlds fastest car :) Anyways, if you would like to make solid gains in the upcoming future invest in NIO.

1. Never quit your job because you make some money off of trading. Have you heard those horror stories of how people win the lottery, quit their job, not manage their finances properly, and end up with a screwed future? Until you accumulate enough low-risk investments that can give you enough passive income for retirement, you should ditch the idea of not working for a living.
2. A future is determined by how hard you work today. Work hard, harder the next day if you're not satisfied with your life tomorrow. If working harder means busting your ass to get educated or skilled, you should do that. If you're low-income and you live in the U.S., you luckily live in a country that makes it really easy for a low-income individual to gain access to free education or training (California has [this](https://home.cccapply.org/money/california-college-promise-grant) for example) - contact your nearest welfare office. You're barely 23 - you have your entire twenties to build your life up. If you are a previous convict or felon, things might be a little tougher but if you're not.. seriously you just need to bust your ass.
3. You have no girlfriend. You've never had one. Big deal. I have no boyfriend. I've never had one. I don't plan to anytime soon because I have other goals that take priority. If you're struggling with low self-esteem because you think your life is so shitty that no one would date you, then prioritize doing something about that life and upgrading it.
4. Resources are available. The U.S. is one of the easiest places to escape the cycle. You can do something about it, it's a mental game. If you end it by 25, then you're missing out big time on the things that could have been in your life. Don't toss something some people can only wish they could have a chance at. You're 23, physically able, with a mind clear enough to think and post on Reddit. Get your shit together.

**Edit: I read in the comments that you're Canadian.**

Government Need-Based Grant for Part-Time: [up to $1800 for two semesters](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/education/grants/part-time.html)

Community college tuition & fees for two full-time semesters in Toronto lands at around $4K (ex. [Centennial](https://www.centennialcollege.ca/admissions/tuition-and-fees/tuition-information/#canadian)). Save money and you could do a part-time UT program and transfer to a university on loans. A college degree, as tacky as it is, will be extremely useful in bettering your life and it's doable no matter how poor or dire your roots are - I paid for my living and education through high school and college by myself through jobs and with help from federal grants and loans.

guy gets info in feb about ROME server chips


multiple sources that dont know eachother

AMD chip architecture will change drastically into a chiplet architeure, Zen 2 ""ROME""

ground up redesigned

eight 7nm core chiplets and a 14nm uncore chip

capable of handling 32 DIMMs with one socket... up to 4 TB of RAM per socket. roadmap for 4 sockets per motherboard

--intel currently only able to handle 24 DIMMs, 3TB for two sockets

going to be manufactured by TSMC early 2019 and available by Q3 2019

INTEL behind the curve by a lot, stuck on 14nm

ROME will have much lower power consumption with a higher performance on a smaller size chip. Huge cost savings when talking about data centers

AMD planning to be positioned strongly with any delay from competitor further strengthening position

--INTEL behind performance and architecture. 

--another source leaked INTEL stopgap chip. two 14nm chips stuck together (Cooper Lake)

--INTEL may have improved 14nm process

--Size of chips are still oversized and require a lot of power

--INTEL Mfg costs low but...

--supply issues on 14nm from INTEL and large scale consumers are being recommended other options (AMD)

--INTEL not able to keep up with demand, customer base moving to different chipsets

--Fewer security issues

Same road VSTM is currently on.",$PRTK - Paratek Pharma DD.,"#**PRTK – Paratek Pharmaceuticals**

#**Overview:**

Paratek Pharmaceuticals is a biotech company based out of Boston, who focuses on providing solutions enabling positive outcomes for patients…Which is literally every other biotech company.  A very generic mission statement, but that is besides the point because they want their story to be remembered, a good play to the social aspect that many companies are trying to be a part of in todays world.  Right now, this company is working on changing how bacterial infections are treated. With the most common treatment of bacterial infections being through intravenous methods, treatments are limited to hospitals and clinics where as they want to continue to develop a new class of antibiotics, aminomethylcyclines, which allows for different, more accessible venues for dosing.  

This company really wants to have a meaningful impact, which is a great sentiment to have.  To back their cause, they do have a successful pipeline so far and show promise.  Their staff and executive team display a long history of success with having worked on a combined 75 late stage developments (phase 3 and beyond), 47 NDA’s or MAA, and 51 product launches.

The CEO has worked with several different biotech industry at an executive or director role such as being a general partner at Abingworth LLP, and even currently serving on the board of directors at Adamas Pharmaceuticals and InMediata.  The COO and CFO both also have extensive history of success with major companies such as Pfizer, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, and Biogen.  All in all, the company has a successful group in the leadership roles where its not their first trip around the block.  They bring experience and knowledge to their positions. 

#**Pipeline:**

As previously mentioned, Paratek develops a class of antibiotics known as aminomethylcyclines, which have broad-spectrum activity against Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and atypical bacteria.  They have two products in their pipeline with several different potential indications.  Both products are derivatives of Tetracycline.  

**Omadacycline**

Omadacycline is a derivative of tetracycline in the form of aminomethycycline.  Over the past 70 years since the inception of tetracycline, an increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance to tetracyclines has made the products much less effective and limited in current use.  Formulated for both IV and oral dosing, Omadacycline is being developed for 5 different indications, with 3 awaiting approval in PDUFA.  

**Sarecycline**

Sarecycline is a Phase III candidate, oral tetracycline derivative being developed for the treatment of acne and rosacea in a community setting because of its narrow spectrum antibiotic characteristics in treating inflammation. The company has licensed all of the US rights to Allergan for the development and commercialization of the product, however retaining all rights outside of the States.  This large partnership shows confidence in the company from a powerhouse in the industry and will provide cashflow while reducing expenses. 

#**Specific Drug:**

We will be focusing on Sarecycline for this write up due to the upcoming PDUFA date which is expected to be mid October.  Paratek has partnered with Allergan to develop and commercialize SeysaraTM (Sarecycline) for the treatment of moderate to severe acne vulgaris in individuals 9 years and older.  Designed to treat acne in a community setting, meaning that it is focused on treating bacteria which is causing acne in communal settings spread through interaction.  

Acne is the most common skin condition in the US, with an affected market of roughly 50 million individuals.  While there are many factors leading to the cause of acne, this company focuses on the bacteria, p. acnes, which lives on human skin and can often clog the pores.  Inside the pore, the bacteria multiply at an astounding rate due to the perfect environment for replication and cause the pore to become inflamed, causing acne to appear.  

Last December, the company and Allergan filed their NDA based on positive data from two Phase III studies, SC1401 and SC1402, which was accepted by the FDA.  The Phase III results met primary endpoints at all levels and revealed patients treated with Seysara demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in acne severity compared to placebo at 12 weeks.  

Both SC1401 & SC1402 were designed to be replicative phase 3 randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 1.5 mg/kg per day of Sarecycline compared to placebo in the treatment of moderate to severe acne.

The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral Sarecycline 1.5 mg/kg per day compared to placebo in treating inflammatory acne lesions in subjects with moderate to severe acne based on Investigators Global Assessment (IGA) scale score and inflammatory lesion counts. Patients were randomized (1:1) into two treatment groups to receive either Sarecycline tablets (60 mg, 100 mg and 150 mg, providing a dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day) or placebo once a day for 12 weeks.

Sarecycline was statistically significantly (p < 0.004) superior to placebo with respect to primary efficacy endpoints. The most common adverse events (>2%) reported in the Sarecycline group were nausea (3.2%), nasopharyngitis (2.8%), and headache (2.8%). The rate of discontinuation due to adverse events among Sarecycline-treated patients in the two studies combined was 1.4%.  The drug has proven itself to be super tolerable, minimal adverse effects, and statistically significant in working effectively. 

 

#**Current and Forecasted Market:**

The Global Cystic Acne Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10% during the forecast period 2017-2023. Mainly owing to increase in patient population. According to American Academy of Dermatology, in 2015, 60 million Americans have active acne and around 20 million have acne badly enough to cause scars.  Additionally, approximately 85% of people between the ages of 12 and 24 experience at least minor acne.  Rising prevalence of this condition in both developed and developing countries is driving the cystic acne market growth.  With Allergan’s license on the US market, this leaves the growing developing world market and European markets open for Paratek to control.  It is estimated by the American Academy of Dermatology Association that in 2016 alone, the costs associated with the treatment of acne exceeded $3 billion.  

Paratek’s focus on community bacteria treatment is ideal for developing countries such as the Asian Pacific, Middle East, and Africa.  While Europe has a huge market for acne treatment, the aforementioned markets are booming at a higher rate.  Countries such as India and China are the fastest growing due to the massive influx of population and high healthcare spending.  While Paratek is making money off of the US market through their license to Allergan, they will also be able to leverage the developed product and work on global commercialization to treat the rapid growing markets that will exceed the US market in short time.

#**Competition**:

There are a ton of tetracycline-based treatments for moderate to severe acne, however it is often revealed that the p. acne bacteria can be resistant to the treatments. The market for streatment of antibiotic-resistant p. acnes is a much smaller market.  A company, Foamix Pharmaceuticals Ltd. FOMX is developing FMX101 in late-stage studies for treating moderate to severe acne.  We shall see the results of their production and late stage study results in coming months.

#**Financials**:

Looking over their financial statements, they have recently strengthened their balance sheet by raising $159 million in proceeds from issuing convertible senior subordinated notes in April set to mature in 6 years.  They also amended the financial terms of the Hercules Loan Agreement they have, increasing the principal taken out by $10 million with the potential for an additional $20 million to be borrowed.  

They recently reported a net loss of $29.7 million, or -$0.94 per share, compared to last years $18.2 million for the same quarter, a YOY increased loss of roughly 50%.  Not good at all, however things are looking to turn around in coming months with pending approval of two drugs with several designations.  Costs were increasing due to the preparation for commercialization and additional headcount, increased marketing, and other commercial costs that the company is taking to prepare for approval and launch.  

The company states that they have cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities that value at a total of $321.1 million.  Their cash and cash equivalents make up $56 million of that value.  Not the best financial situation.

#**Review:**

My thoughts, MAYBE a short term buy.  It is currently trending down and could be bought for a swing trade up towards approval.  Between Sarecycline and also the coming potential approval of Omadacycline in early October, this stock can see a big swing up.  You can review the information on Omadacycline below, its well-articulated in their presentation and likely to be approved. 

http://paratekpharma.com/media/1598/corporate-september-2018.pdf

However, I have my doubts about the company.  They have diluted shares several times around events and it seems like a common trend for the company.  Antibiotics is a tough market to launch in and be successful in.  Thankfully with their partnership with Allergan, they can see success in that drug.  Allergan is a massive company with a massive sales force that will literally go to physicians and shove the product down their throats.  However, with Omadacycline, they have no such partnership.  Likely to see a weak launch, the company will probably burn a ton of cash fast trying to market the product Omadacycline, but will likely see income generated from the licensing of Sarecycline.  Will it offset, unlikely.  The company will likely take a hit trying to market off a weak launch, dilute investors even further to raise capital shortly after approval.  That, or the company will move to take on more debt, drawing that additional $20 million from their loan agreement.  

My plan of action, buy a position now at $9.30 and increase size of position if I see $8.75-8.50.  Sell immediately after news if positive with a price target of $11.  This will likely be a short-term play.  However, I would also consider waiting until approval to even make a move.  With their financial position and history of dilutions, I see the stock taking a hit following the results from the FDA throughout October.  The company’s plan and pipeline will see no short-term success.  Their plan is to lay the tracks down for future revenues and market share, with success coming in 3+ years.  I can see a smart play waiting until early November to enter a position, after both drugs have received notice from the FDA and following the stocks likely drop and holding a long-term, 3+ year position. 



#TLDR

Two options here.  Buy now and maybe average down if it drops under $9, then sell immediately on news.  Or, wait until after news comes out on the two drug candidates expected in October and then buy.  I would personally wait to buy following news and potential dilution.  The company has a history of diluting shares and I can see them doing it within a week or two of approval, if not same day.  I would look to buy for long term, 3+ years, early November as they are laying groundwork for future success and revenues.

#**Overview:**

Immune Design is a clinical-stage immunotherapy company focused on developing treatments to enable the body’s own immune system to fight diseases.  Their focus lies on the oncology sector, having engineered technologies to activate the immune system’s natural ability to create tumor-specific cytotoxic T Cells to fight cancer.  Their belief is that their two main drug candidates will address what other therapies are currently lacking while having the potential to treat a broad patient population through either individual therapies or in conjunction with other mechanisms of action.  Although their main focus is the immuno-oncology, they believe that their candidates also have potential to serve in therapeutic realms such as infectious and allergic diseases as they have a few different collaboration and partnerships underway leveraging their GLAAS platforms.  

Immune Design’s management team, board of directors, and scientific advisory board boast a diverse group of individuals who don’t lack experience in the industry.  The CEO, Carlos Paya, has served as Vice President at Eli Lilly, President of Elan Corporation, and was also a professor of Medicine, Immunology, and Pathology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.  The company also has an extensive list of Doctors and PhD researchers backing the company’s advisory board and management team.
  

#**Pipeline:**

The company currently has 6 different products in their pipeline ranging from Preclinical to Phase II.  Still in the early stages of development, the company is actively seeking growth and partnerships to solidify their financial and developmental future.  Each of their GLAAS products, 3 of them, have partnerships lined up for the development and licensing of the candidates.  These partnerships include Sanofi, MedImmune, and Sanofi Pasteur.   To match their product collaborations, they are also working in conjunction with Merck and Genetech in clinical collaborations to evaluate the safety and efficacy of their immuno-oncology products. 
Their immuno-oncology pipeline also has 3 candidates targeting different forms of cancer.  Their entire pipeline is as follows:

 

#**Specific Drug:**

While the company has several different products filling their pipeline, we are concerned with CMB305.  Immune Design has entered into a clinical trial collaboration with Genetech, a member of Roche, to better evaluate the safety and efficacy of CMB305 cancer immunotherapy when combined with the investigational cancer immunotherapy atezolizumab in patients with soft tissue sarcoma.  

CMB305 is a prime-boost product designed to target tumors that express the NY-ESO-1 tumor antigen, specifically soft tissue sarcoma.  NY-ES0-1 is expressed in a large number of solid and liquid state tumors in varying degrees.  CMB305 is comprised of two parts, a “prime” and a “boost”, which are designed to work synergistically to induce anti-tumor cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response targeting the NY-ES0-1-expressing tumors.  It is also hypothesized that CMB305 will also generate memory CTLs, providing for long-term immune response systems while enhancing other immune anti-tumor mechanisms along the way.  

Currently, CMB305 is in different stages of clinical development, which include monotherapy Phase I as well as a fully-enrolled Phase II trial comprised of individuals with two subtypes of soft tissue sarcoma (synovial sarcoma or myxoid/round-cell liposarcoma).  This combination study is utilizing either CMB305 with Genetech’s cancer immunotherapy TECENTRIQ, or atezolizumab alone. 

Last year, the company reported positive clinical and biomarker data for CMB305 as a monotherapy.  In 25 soft tissue sarcoma (STS) patients with recurrent disease treated with CMB305, median overall survival (mOS) had still not yet been reached, with an overall survival rate at 12 and 18 months of 83% and 76%, respectively. These data compare favorably to mOS for approved second line and later sarcoma agents, which is only 12.4-13.5 months, as well as a published mOS of 11.7 months for synovial sarcoma patients specifically; the largest patient population enrolled in this trial. A disease control rate of 64% was observed, including durable tumor growth arrest in patients who had evidence of disease progression at study entry. Also, CMB305 was well tolerated, and generated a strong and broad anti-NY-ESO-1 immune response in >50% of the patients, including evidence of antigen spreading – the induction of an immune response against other tumor antigens not targeted by CMB305. In addition, the presented data showing a statistically-significant association of an induced response and clinical benefit in a pooled set of patients treated with CMB305 or LV305. The immune biomarkers studied, including novel bio-markers derived from public TCRS may guide regulatory strategy via the selection of patients more likely to have survival benefit on CMB305 therapy benchmarks. 

Immune Design has received Orphan Drug Designation in soft tissue sarcoma for both components of CMB305 in the EU and US, and depending upon further trial results soft tissue sarcoma will be the first indication in which CMB305 will be filed for regulatory approval.  There is a significant unmet need in this market, and the company holds the stance that the potential benefit of CMB305 to patients will be higher safety for patients and improved survival rates. 


#**Current and Forecasted Market:**

Synovial sarcoma is a cancer in the joints with a five-year and ten-year survival for people with Grade 3 tumors or metastatic disease of less than 25% and 15%, respectively, and Myxoid round cell liposarcoma is a malignant tumor that most often occurs in the deep-seated soft tissues of the extremities. Currently marketed treatments have high toxicity, with up to 37% of patients experiencing Grade 3/4 Adverse Events. 
Soft tissue sarcoma is rapidly growing, expected to reach a global CAGR of over 8% over the next 6 years.  With over 50 different types of soft tissue sarcoma, it is a rare and diverse group of cancers that can develop from nearly any tissue.  There are approximately 13,000 individuals who suffer from soft tissue sarcoma each year, and with a high incidence rate and increased awareness about the condition, the market is expected to continue to expand.  
The current soft tissue sarcoma market size is valued around $700 million as of 2017, and with an expected CAGR of more than 8%, In 2017, 12,715 new diagnosis and 5,070 deaths due to STS were reported in the U.S. Bone sarcomas accounted for 3,373 new cases and 1,649 deaths in 2017. The lifetime risk of developing a sarcoma is 0.4%. Approximately 45.0% of bone sarcomas and 21.0% of STS are diagnosed in people in the age group of 0-35 years.  Currently, chemotherapy and targeted therapy are the only approved treatments for sarcoma.  Several immuno-oncology agents are also under investigation, with Immune Design leading the forefront to fill this unmet market need. 


#**Competition:**

The largest market competition are companies such as GlaxoSmithKline, Eli Lilly, Pfizer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Johnson & Johnson, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, and Celgene and others.  However, not all of these companies are focusing on developments in immuno-oncology and developing long term body resistance to tumors.   There is a large market for immuno-oncology that is unmet and waiting to be filled.  Novartis holds roughly 30% of the market share for sarcoma treatment, which Immune Design seeks to start to take if the product becomes approved.  


Financials:

MDZ reported loss of 29 cents per share in second-quarter 2018, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 30 cents and the year-ago loss of 54 cents.

Immune Design’s shares have lost 8.9% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 1.2%.  However their revenues are up this quarter YOY to $0.76 million mainly due to the collaboration with Sanofi for G103 and product sales to collaboration partners.  R&D expenses are increasing as they are moving along their extensive pipeline through the clinical phases.   

Biggest note on their finances, Immune Design expects cash on hand to be enough to fund operations through the second half of 2020.  Due to their strategic partnerships and financing, the company is able to limit diluting investors or taking on greater debt.  The company has enough cash and cash equivalents, $73 million, to finance all operations for more than a year, which is a very rare occurrence in these small cap biotech companies. 


#**Review:**

My sort of concerns, the low rate of success that oncology drug candidates have with the FDA.  Cancer is a tough market.  Data shows that cancer drugs have the lowest success rate of making it from Phase I to FDA approval, a mere 3.4%.  Although, cancer trials that used biomarkers had higher success rates, though, and the overall oncology drug approval rate for 2015 was 8.3%, which was due to the booming immuno-oncology field.  So, although oncology drugs lag, immuno-oncology pulls does not.  The past few years, especially under the Trump administration, drug approval rates have been higher than ever in recent history.  

For this product, Phase II studies patients and provides researchers with additional safety data to refine research questions and develop further methodologies to study the candidate and efficacy.  They utilize this data to formulate Phase III protocols.  Will not really reveal any benefits of the drug or therapeutic effects, rather simply show the safety of the product with some minor data.

As stated earlier, the company believes that CMB305 to patients will be higher safety for patients and improved survival rates.  Along with Orphan Designation and the need to get effective drugs approved in the Oncology market, I believe the FDA will try to push a product such as this through. I have no fear of dilution due to the cash on hand to hold them for another two years. 

Looking at their chart, the stock price has held a $3.30 support zone for the past year, consistently bouncing off of these low levels producing 10% plus gains and even going as far up as $5.00 just a few months ago.  The volatility of this stock is fairly high, and I would personally use this to my advantage.  They diluted with a $80 million offering in October 2017 causing a massive drop in share price.  I doubt the company will seek to ruin their shareholder base further any time soon.  I feel a purchase at under $3.40 is a great move and holding for $4.00 minimum.  


#**TLDR**:

Shit looks like a solid buy at this cheap support level.  They are showing safety in their studies or hinting at it, Phase II is all about safety, and with the Orphan Drug designation they have potential to meet a dire need.  Plenty of cash on hand, already screwed their investors with a dilution a year ago, dont have to worry about a dilution for another year or so as they have cash on hand to operate for two years.  I can see a 20-30% increase in the next month or two going from $3.30 to $4.00 as my minimum price target.

COUP hit $84.60ish on 9/5 (from $72 on 9/4). It’s been coiling in the maximum range of $76-82 for several days ever since it hit ATH.  IMO it could make an attempt to break it this coming week. A very similar stock I’ve seen do this recently is ROKU after it hit ATH, coiled, then obliterated it’s ATH maybe a week after. I bought $80 strike 9/21 expiry @$1.20 premium at $79.20 before close. 

Another one I think is set for continuation is LMT. It was at $320 two days ago and has now climbed to 335.80. I saw resistances at low $335s which is why I didn’t take a pos. but in AH they announced a $7.2b w/ the Air Force. Could be a nice little runner next week.

Ideally would like one red day with LMT so the premiums can cool off a bit but other than that those are my two biggest plays going into next week.

**TL;DR; Buy $AMC $20 9/28 or 10/19 calls and wait for new A-List membership press release THIS WEEK.**

**Silver Lake Investment**

- https://www.silverlake.com/Images/Uploads/docs/Silverlake1409181248166028.pdf

- Silver Lake, a very TECH focused PE firm, **invested $600M** into AMC while Wanda gets to lower their holdings in AMC because they HAVE TO due to Chinese government mandating companies lower their foreign investments

- This alleviates a huge looming concern about Wanda selling on the open market. They've committed to holding onto the rest, saying they've satisfied Chinese government concerns, and if they choose to sell more, Silver Lake has said they will be the ones buying OTC

- Shareholders will also get a **special dividend of $1.55** payable on 9/28 to all shareholders of
record as of 9/25, that's an almost 8% dividend as of the current price. Expect a run-up in price leading up to the record date

**Competition**

- **MoviePass is absolutely shitting the bed**, announcing another [reverse split](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-17/moviepass-seeks-to-bolster-shares-with-1-for-500-reverse-split) and tons of people cancelling as seen on /r/moviepass 

- Sinemia announced a $30/month unlimited plan but suffers from the same problem with lack of revenue on concessions and limited to 2D screenings only https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/17/moviepass-competitor-sinemia-launches-unlimited-plan/

- A trivial lawsuit has also been cleared https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/amc-settles-lawsuit-viva-cinemas-alleged-conspiracy-major-studios-1143574

**Fundamental Analysis**

- AMC displays short video ads for A-List on every screening which is effectively free advertising. They can also subscribe you to A-List and apply your ticket purchase to the first month right at the ticket window which is a great up-sell

- A-List allows you to watch 3D, Dolby, and IMAX which is what the theater experience is all about these days

- AMC makes huge money on high-margin concession sales. AMC is smart, they've done the math for A-List and they know that more butts in seats equals more profits from concessions even if they take a small loss from frequent movie-goers

**Movie Industry**

- The movie industry is looking to have a **record year**, no matter how you slice it on BoxOfficeMojo, the numbers are amazing every month, quarter, and year for 2018 https://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/?view2=ytdcompare&compare=ytd&p=.htm

- The reason for AMC's sharp decline in 2017 was primarily because of a horrible box office year, but 2018 had a monster beginning of the year, a record August which is traditionally the worst month, and a huge lineup to end the year AND an amazing 2019 if you pay attention to /r/boxoffice

- Just look at how shitty 2017 August movies were https://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=4326&p=.htm

- The movie industry is also relatively un-impacted by trade war fears, consumer discretionary has been high this year and movies fall under that categroy

**MONEY-MAKER: A-List Growth**

- A-List launched on June 26

- 5 weeks later on July 31 they had 175,000 subscribers

- 7 weeks later on August 17 they had 260,000 subscribers

- If they continued at that same rate, they would have 430,000 subscribers right now

- Their goal was 500,000 members by June 2019 and 1 million members at June of 2020

- **HERE'S THE MONEY-MAKER**. The CEO on their [conference call](https://services.choruscall.com/links/amc180914.html) about the investment off-the cusp at the 15:50 mark said:

> A-List really is on quite a roll. We're only 80 days into this new effort and we have already blown **WAY PAST** 300,00 enrolled members. We intend to put out the latest numbers updated for you early next week for your edification. A-List is a hit.

- The emphasis on **WAY PAST** was clear in his tone. And a press release this week announcing the new numbers. Investors love subscription businesses as that means consistent revenue and AMC is absolutely dominating the post-MoviePass world, just take a look at /r/AMCsAList and the number of people saying they moved over on /r/moviepass/ /r/MoviePassClub/

**Leverage**

- Moody's today has signaled they're maintaining AMC's debt rating despite the additional $600 million in convertible notes https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-says-AMC-ratings-unchanged-following-issuance-of-600-million--PR_389036

- This is HUGE because the reason for the dramatic dip on Friday was because of Eric Handler at MKM Partners downgrading AMC from Buy to Hold (while keeping the Price Target at $21) because of the debt concern. He was even the first person to ask a question on their conference call! AMC has traditionally had a problem holding a lot of debt but is working on actively paying it down https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amcs-stock-swings-lower-mkm-downgrade-follows-silver-lake-investment-special-dividend-2018-09-14

- Also the way convertible debts work, Silver Lake is almost guaranteed to want to convert this to shares thus it's not really debt in the long-term

**Share this DD with your friends and the press. I STILL don't think the broader retail market knows about all this yet and the updated A-List subscriber count is going to catch a lot of people by surprise**

This is what gives the dollar value not its status as reserve. You have cause and effect backwards here. Essentially nothing should change if nothing noted above changes. People will continue to desire dollars and due to us being the top income producers/consumers dollars will continue to dominate the global economy. The net effect will be a short term downturn as people try to figure out your arbitrary ruling but once they realize the underlying economic factors are the same, the dollar will return to its intrinsic value.",The Value of the Dollar,"I have recently began thinking about this topic as I haven’t really seen good discussions about it before. Let’s pretend that tomorrow everybody in the world decides that the dollar will lose its reserve status. Let’s pretend that investors don’t overreact and overemphasize the drop in the USD value. And let’s pretend the dropping of the reserve status does not cause a national debt crisis in the US. Don’t ask me how but let’s just pretend that happens. 

Goods and services in the international market no longer trades in USD. They are settled between the national currencies of the trading countries. And central banks balance their reserve baskets with a more equitable basket of currencies, relative to GDP. 

We know in this scenario, the USD will drop in value even if investors don’t overreact. My question is how much will it drop by? 10%? 20%? Would it be fair to assume that the true value of the USD is this value and that the current value is based on the notion that the dollar is the reserve currency and thus trades at a premium. Effectively meaning that every US citizen has artificially high purchasing power? Is this the reason that the consumer culture and the resulting large twin deficits really took off in the states compared to the rest of the world? Because to Americans, stuff is generally cheap?
Would love some discussion about this.

**3:01 pm edit**

There is a small bullish case. Because of the % rate at which AMD has increased in such a short little while, the log normal chart vs non-log charts are slightly different in that the latter shows that we are in a channel that has not broken down yet, and there is a potential for a price bounce.

I shamelessly ripped this one off the discord to make sure you guys have all the details. If this channel breaks as well, it is legit goodbye AMD. Risk seeking longs will exit on the channel break of the non-log chart below while risk averse longs will have exited on the bearish ascending wedge breakdown earlier this morning (posted in the charts above).

Good luck, not like most of you deserve it tho.

Lost both parents to cancer and I'm always trying to keep these types of companies prominently in my portfolio.  Thanks.,$KURA - Kura Oncology DD,"#**$KURA – Kura Oncology**

**Overview:**

Kura Oncology was created in 2007 and is based in California.  The company is utilizing the genomic revolution to transform how cancer is treated, understanding that a patient’s response to treatment depends partially on the cancer’s genetic makeup.  With an advancing pipeline of precision medicines for the treatment of both solid tumors and blood cancers, their small-molecule candidates specifically target signaling pathways and other drivers of cancers where there is a strong scientific and clinical rationale to improve the outcomes by identifying patients most likely to benefit from treatment. 

The CEO of the company is well versed in the biotech industry as he is not only CEO of Kura, but also a member of the board of directors for Puma Biotechnology, Zosano Pharma, as well as president and CEO of Wellspring Biosciences, Araxes Pharma, and Avidity Biosciences.  Along with his history in the biotech industry, his management, advisory, and leadership teams are all stacked with extensive experience.  While the resume is quite impressive, it does strike concern in me that this man is a member of several executive boards as well as CEO and president of several different companies.  I believe a pharma company that is pushing multiple candidates in their pipeline through Phase I and II studies should not have his attention diverted between 5+ different companies.  

Anyways, the company has three primary focuses for their development.  Precision Medicines, Targeted Therapeutics, and Biomarkers.  Utilizing precision medicine, they want to discover and develop innovative therapies designed to inhibit abnormally functioning cellular pathways that drive cancer growth.  These two categories will be paired with molecular diagnostics to identify biomarkers specific to tumors to better decide which patients will likely respond to treatments. 

**Pipeline:**

The company currently has 3 different candidates within its pipeline, with their flagship product being Tipifarnib.  This oral, investigational drug candidate is currently being evaluated in multiple Phase II clinical trials for four different indications.


Tipifarnib – Farnesyl Transferase Inhibitor

KO-947 – ERK Inhibitor

KO-539 – Menin-MLL Inhibitor


Tipifarnib is the most advanced drug in their pipeline, the furthest developed at Phase II while the others are in Phase I and preclinical.  We will discuss Tipifarnib below.  

KO-947 is being evalued in Phase I, and operates by blocking the activity of the enzyme extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which is a critical component of signaling pathways that has been implicated in various cancer processes, including survival, growth, and proliferation of tumor cells.  Phase I clinical trials are being conducted on patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic, relapsed, and/or refractory non-hematological malignancies.  Below is a poster presentation of the studies and function of this drug candidate.  

https://kuraoncology.com/wp-content/uploads/Burrows-AACR-2018.pdf

KO-539 is being evaluated in preclinical testing for treatment of specific types of leukemia.  Functioning by blocking the interaction of two proteins, menin and MLL that together, are critically important for survival, growth, and proliferation of certain kinds of leukemia cells.  Below is a poster presentation of the research being conducted on this candidate. 

https://kuraoncology.com/wp-content/uploads/2017-AACR-NCI-EORTC-Menin-Formatted-Poster-2017-10-18.pdf


**Specific Drug:**

While Kura has a relatively new pipeline, their main candidate is Tipifarnib.  This flagship product is being studied for four different indications at the company, however we are focused on one specifically.  For the indication of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinomas (HNSCC), this mid October the company is going to be presenting updated data from their Phase II study at the European Society for Medical Oncology.  In conjunction with that presentation, the company plans on initiating a pivotal trial in Phase III in the second half of 2018, which could very well land right around their presentation, providing a great opportunity for price action moving upwards.

Tipifarnib, an oral drug that functions by blocking the activity of an enzyme called farnesyl transferase.  Protein farnesylation is a key signaling process implicated in various cancer processes, including survival, growth, and proliferation of tumor cells.  With more than 5,000 oncology patients having been studied on the drug and observed to have manageable side effects, it is suggested that tipifarnib has the potential to provide benefits to specific cancer patients with limited treatment options. 

For the specific indication and use in patients with Head and Neck Cancers, the company is evaluating tipifarnib in patients that carry HRAS mutations.  HRAS is a proto-oncogene, a gene that has the potential to cause cancer, that when mutations occur or there is an increased expression, can cause this normal gene to become cancerous.  Proto-oncogenes code for proteins that help regulate cell growth and differentiation, and HRAS is mutated or expressed in certain head or neck squamous cell carcinoma tumors.  HRAS has been known for over 40 years, yet there are no targeted therapies for tumors with the mutated form of HRAS.  The company hopes that its product tipifarnib will selectively inhibit farnesyltransferase, a critical enzyme for the activity in HRAS.  The relapsed or refractory HNSCC patient population has a survival rate of six to eight months and existing therapeutic options only produce a response rate of 10 to 20 percent. For this reason, HRAS is often called an undruggable oncogene.  

HRAS mutations are observed in 5% of HNSCC cases, generating a direct need that has no products to fill.  Early research shows that tipifarnib induces deep, sustained regression in HRAS mutations.  Clinical proof -of-concept has been achieved in HRAS mutated HNSCC cases with durable responses being observed.  So farm, Kura’s research is demonstrating that HRAS is a targetable mutation in HNSCC and illustrates that there is potential for tipifarnib in the treatment of additional HRAS-mutant squamous cell carcinomas.  

So far, preliminary Phase II data which will be updated soon demonstrates many positive points.  Tipifarnib demonstrates an overall response rate of 83% in its patients and is not only generally well tolerated, but also shows a benefit in use.  HRAS mutant HNSCC patients saw no benefit from prior therapies including chemotherapy, cetuximab, and immunotherapy, however patients had responded well or provided a partial response when treated with tipifarnib.  This data is displaying that the mutant HRAS oncogenes are targetable as well as providing evidence that tipifarnib is effective for recurrent or metastatic HNSCC carrying HRAS mutations.  This was confirmed in 5 of 6 HNSCC patients and did so with rapid responses where other treatments had failed to provide any response.  

Here is a poster presenting the data, research, and more of the indication of tipifarnib in HNSCC.

**Market Outlook and Competition:**

This market looks like it will continue to grow higher in the foreseeable future.  Driven mainly by alcohol and tobacco abuse, it is expected that the global head and neck cancer market will grow at an astounding CAGR of 22.6% from 2018 to 2023.  This would push the market to reach $2.3 billion by the end of that growth period.  The World Health Organization estimates that there are more than 550,000 cases and nearly 300,000 deaths worldwide each year.  Roughly 90% of head and neck cancers are squamous cell carcinomas, creating the sixth leading cancer by occurrence.  An estimated 63,000 Americans developing head and neck cancer annually, and 13,000 dying of this disease. In Europe, there were approximately 250,000 cases of cancer registered and 63,500 deaths in 2012.  Looking back at our numbers earlier, roughly 5% of these cases are due to HRAS mutations, the precise market that Kura is targeting and has no current, successful treatment option. 

Drugs approved for head and neck cancer include Abitrexate (Methotrexate), Blenoxane (Bleomycin), Bleomycin, Cetuximab, Docetaxel, Erbitux (Cetuximab), Folex (Methotrexate), Folex PFS (Methotrexate), Hydrea (Hydroxyurea), Hydroxyurea, Keytruda (Pembrolizumab), Methotrexate, Methotrexate LPF (Methotrexate), Mexate (Methotrexate), Mexate-AQ (Methotrexate), Nivolumab, Opdivo (Nivolumab), Pembrolizumab, Taxotere (Docetaxel). Drug combinations used in head and neck cancer include TPF – Docetaxel (Taxotere), Cisplatin (Platinol), and Fluorouracil. Drugs in the phase III clinical pipeline for SCCHN include Avelumab, Durvalumab, Gilotrif/Giotrif (afatinib), Multikine (leukocyte interleukin), Tremelimumab, and Yervoy (ipilimumab). The immune checkpoint inhibitors (durvalumab, tremelimumab, ipilimumab and avelumab) are expected to obtain approval by 2021.  However, none of these products are specifically targeting HRAS mutations.

**Finances:**

The company recently underwent a public offering of common stock on July 2, 2018 in which the company sold an aggregate of 4,600,000 shares of common stock at a price of $16.75 per share. Net proceeds from the public offering, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses, were approximately $74.5 million.  This Q2 2018, the company posted R&D expenses of $11.5 million, more than double that of Q2 2017 and a 50% increase in administrative expenses.  The net los for the quarter was $14.7 million, or $0.45 per share, again more than double the loss of last year, but only a $0.05 loss per share due mostly to the dilution which occurred this past July.  
Kura does have cash and cash equivalents which total $200.4 million due to the raise in capital form the offering, which will allow the company to have enough cash to fund current operations through 2021.  Thankfully for investors, this means that they do not plan on diluting any time soon.  I would however likely expect a dilution in about a year, around the same time they did this year just to keep the cash on hand at a high level.


**Review:**

This company looks promising.  This product has a decently sized market that is expected to grow at over 20% for the next 5 years.  That is an astounding number that provides a great opportunity for Kura to fill an unmet need.  The stock has been trading between $14 and $24 through 2018, and is settled right now at a good support level of $16.75.  It has traded down this past month after posting an earnings loss and following the dilution, however I see a turn around coming.  

With the high amount of cash on hand and updated data coming out as they present at the ESMO as well as initiating a Phase III study in coming weeks/months, you will see a pop in price here. This company might be a great long-term hold, as they are producing a product that will fill an unmet need, however success at the end of the road is not guaranteed.  Oncology drugs that pass Phase I have only shown a likelihood of approval of 5%, compared to an average of 12% for all other indications outside of oncology. 

Short term, Phase II data is really showing safety.  I see that survival rates for HNSCC are low, incident rates are high, and this drug is well tolerable.  I think Phase II will see success and going into Phase III you will see a price increase.  Results from Phase III however is a different story.  My play here would be a short to medium term investment for now.  Their flagship drug has 4 indications that seem to have high potential as well as two other candidates in their pipeline.  There will be activity over the next year and with the volatility and price range that this stock sees, I think anything around $16 would be a good buy as we will likely see $22 before the start of 2019.


#**TLDR**

Looks like a good buy under $17 for a swing play up to at least $20.  Long term iffy, oncology doesnt have a high rate of approval from the FDA, but there is an unmet market need this company fills.  With 3 drugs and 6 drug indications, they have potential to continue to rise.  Recently diluted shares, have cash to last 3 years, they should be a great buy here and hold for a few months to maybe a year.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9gxows/kura_kura_oncology_dd/,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9gxows/kura_kura_oncology_dd/

TLDR: Blackout will sell more than the Street estimates

&#x200B;

Last time I did a DD on Snap I didn't make it serious enough so I guess people didn't listen. Here with the next play though. Please read through the whole thing and give me your thoughts.

&#x200B;

Blackout. Activision is close to an all time high because of excitement about Blackout. The beta was good, reviews are great. People are hyped. The opportunity stems from the fact that the sales estimates for the New COD are WAY too conservative. I expect Activision's sales to blow expectations out of the water and lead $100 stock price within a couple months. I'll describe my thinking below.

&#x200B;

Morgan Stanley's latest report has their BULL CASE at around 23 mm units sold. They claim if that happens they expect a $100 stock price.

&#x200B;

The last two shitty COD games sold about 12 mm. Lets call those guys the Loyalists. They all plan to buy this next game so that's an automatic 12mm.

&#x200B;

PUBG which is the closest comparison to Blackout has sold 50 mm (same price). Everyone who has played the beta so far has said that Blackout is way superior to PUBG. It's someone took PUBG and had an actual well funded studio produce it. Given that the games appeal to the same demographic and Blackout is just better, I don't think it's a stretch to say that at least 50% of people who bought PUBG will buy Blackout. That gives us another 25mm copies sold. BUT, lets be super conservative and say that all of the COD loyalists also had PUBG, so we'll subtract 12 from 25 and get an additional 13 mm units sold.

&#x200B;

So far this leaves us with 25mm units sold. That is already surpassing Morgan Stanley's even bullish expectations. BUT THAT'S NOT ALL OF THE SALES. We have to account for the Fortnite effect. Fortnite is a very kid friendly game and they have about 80-100 mm non-mobile players. For many of these players, Fortnite might be the very first shooter they've played. In other words Fortnite has expanded the shooter market. On top of that all of the top streamers: Ninja, Lupo, Courage etc have been streaming the blackout beta. Ninja even had 250K+ for one of his streams for blackout. The point is that players (some quite young) who play fortnite and have never bought PUBG or COD may be enticed to try blackout because it's hyped, streamers are playing it etc. In fact Ninja is even headlining a Blackout tourney at Twitch con ([link](http://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/24677842/ninja-headline-call-duty-competition-twitchcon)). So lets say out of the 40 mm or so of fortnite players who didn't play pubg (some may be Old COD fans like myself but havent bought a cod in years), 10 mm will look to buy Blackout.

&#x200B;

That leaves us with \~35mm units sold, which is almost 50% better than THE MORGAN STANLEY BULL CASE. So point is that there is definitely some upside. that 35mm by the way isn't crazy for a call of duty game. The first black ops sold 32mm and that was half a decade ago, so the market has certainly expanded since then.

&#x200B;

KEY RISKS: 

1. Fortnite's free-ness makes people hesitant to buy a $60 games ( alot of PUBG sales came before Fortnite became huge)
2. Fortnite is so addicting that current Fortnite users may not even feel the need to buy Blackout
3. Other aspects of ATVI shit the bed (like King) and even if the DD is right. Stock goes down.

&#x200B;

Anyway the conclusion from this is that you should just throw your money on MU Weeklies and AMD puts, but if you have some leftover, consider buying some ATVI.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9gycou/atvi_serious_dd_is_the_street_underestimating/,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9gycou/atvi_serious_dd_is_the_street_underestimating/

What hasn't been reported as much is that MU is expanding its presence in Silicon Valley. As you all know, Silicon Valley is a high cost of living area and the salaries are astronomical. Companies move here for one reason, and one reason only, to gain access to the deep pool of high tech engineers.

Well, MU has bought (or leased) a set of three buildings from Brocade and they're expanding their R&D. The buildings are not for manufacturing because nobody in their right mind would open a manufacturing facility smack dab in Silicon Valley (except Tesla). 

Here is the original building for Brocade: https://media.glassdoor.com/l/9183/brocade-communications-office.jpg

Here is Micron moving into those buildings: https://i.postimg.cc/5yqxGcT1/IMG_0294.jpg

MU is joining the likes of AMD, Intel, and NVDA in Silicon Valley (OK, they've been here for awhile but now they're really serious). You don't need Silicon Valley brain power to do commodities technology.

Thoughts on the Nike upcoming earnings report. First off, call is on 9/25 after close, I'm getting 9/28 calls tomorrow.

Nike is up about 10% since last quarter (May: $71 - Aug: $78). Kaepernick ad increased sales by like 30% I believe and now this report just came out: [https://www.foxbusiness.com/retail/nikes-number-of-sold-out-products-spiked-after-kaepernick-ad-report](https://www.foxbusiness.com/retail/nikes-number-of-sold-out-products-spiked-after-kaepernick-ad-report)

 \- Alot of sold-out Nike products basically

We won't see those this ER but the news will probably drive it up even more.

Nike has beat their last 4 ER's and the stock has popped on the last one big May's ER: Stock jumped $8 after ER!

This quarter runs from May - Aug. Here's where I think it may beat even more. 

This year was the World Cup- largest sporting event in the world. Even bigger than that, Nike sponsored 10 teams (Adidas sponsored 12) and out of those 10 teams, 3/4 were in the top 4 teams and France (Nike) won this WC. Perhaps there was more revenue as Nike sponsored national teams grew closer to the finals and after France won! In addition, Nike sponsored Nigeria and saw a record breaking jersey preorder of 3 million Nigerian official jerseys. Nike also sponsored more individual player's boots with 60% of the top 200 players being sponsored (including Neymar, Ronaldo and Kane). Finally, Nike has outperformed Adidas stock in 4/5 past world cups, I expect them to do the same this year.

Nike's EPS (0.62) is lower than the past few ER's by a few cents, even given the WC additional revenue. It has beaten 6/6 of the past ER's and I expect it will do the same this time.

\> What's everyones thoughts? I'm gonna grab a few $85 calls and $88 - 9/28 at open tomorrow, especially with todays dip I think this will be good. Hoping to see another $6-10 jump after earnings.

Goodluck everyone!

Pick one.,"Do you think government debt will ever impact the American economy and stock market? While the debt has risen 8.3% per year from 1966 to 2018, the stock market is up 10% per year.","If high debt was a problem, it would have caused some trouble in this period. It’s wrong to suggest the high government debt made the 2008 crisis bad because it was consumer debt that was the problem. The MMT believers don’t know the tipping point where debt becomes a problem, yet they think the government should spend more money. You can look at the currency crisis in Venezuela to see how governments are far from infallible.

The government is bloated with debt this cycle unlike consumers and corporations, but it’s not clear if we are near the tipping point. If the government doesn’t hit the tipping point soon, there’s not much evidence to suggest the next recession will be devastating like 2008 or the Great Depression.

This outcome is so much better for shareholders than most people probably realize! There are a lot of comments across several platforms where people are claiming to have cancelled their preorders for the 2080ti and are picking up a 1080ti instead; however, if you check out tracking websites, such as nowinstock.net, the 2080ti is still sold out. Additionally, the 2080 is sold out at many vendors, but not all.

The people that don't care about blowing a lot of money on new tech (myself included) for less than linear performance gains will buy the new cards in great enough numbers. While the normies that don't want to spend that much for the top of the line will deplete the supply of the old generation of cards. Then after the old cards are gone, the turing cards will come down in price and capitalize on the people that were holding out for the price drop.

Additionally, the new architecture seems poised to be much more powerful for the professional market (with the non-gaming cards) with the addition of AI focused cores. It seems similar to AMDs development of Ryzen-TR-EPYC as a ""glued together"" scalable architecture. Not exactly the same, but primarily developed for higher end, higher margin markets (data center) while able to provide value to regular consumers.

The stock price has not caught on yet, and may continue to fall over the next month, but this is good for NVDA. I'm calling 300-315 by Janurary.

I love $SSTI and I am holding a core position long term, but I've trimmed a lot between $55 and $60. They are pretty expensive now when comparing their ev/sales to other high growth software companies.

$EVBG, however, is much more attractive. I believe it has a lot of upside that we can see in the next few months. They have a lot of long term contracts which helps reduce long term risk. They have strong, accelerating revenue growth and they are being smart in their efforts to balance growth vs their path towards profitability. They are currently trading at around 12.5x ev/2018 sales. IMO they warrant at least 16x, implying an upside of \~28%, or \~$74 per share (trades around $58 now). 16x ev/2018 sales would be much more in line with what we see in other small cap/high growth tech companies.

I want to sell covered calls to profit off this insane IV without exposing myself to too much risk (wrong subreddit, I know). What am I missing with these example scenarios?

Say I sell 2x 9/21 270c to some chump for $15.00 a share in premium. I pocket 3k here.

Best case, of course, is that those calls expire worthless and I make off with the free money.

TLRY could find the earth's core again, in which case I'm bagholding shares (which I would likely deserve) but at least I keep the premium, which helps dry my tears a bit.

Worst case, say TLRY hits $300 again and the contracts exercise. I lose out on potential profit from selling at $300 a share, but I at least get some gains because I bought at 228 and sold at 270, plus I got to keep the original premium.

What scenarios am I missing and why am I retarded?

Also, is it better practice to repurchase the calls I sold near EOD tomorrow in case someone exercises them OTM anyway (not likely, but i'm trying to imagine all scenarios)?

CC is looking great so far!

• Record SSD revenue due to SATA SSD

• Storage lead to 13% of total revenue

• DRAM is 70% of total revenue
    • ASP (average sale price) is unchanged sequentially but higher shipments lead to higher revenue in segment. (This is the same thing CFO said 3 weeks ago)!

• NAND ASP did actually decline by about 12% even though sales increased by 30%

• CFO is optimistic about the future and Micron is going to be hiring 1000 new employees in order to expand the business. (Great sign in my opinion)

• Focus of 2019 will be on expanding DRAM market, leaning more toward the first-half of FY2019

• Cash position declined in Q4, but used that cash to reduce debt by $6.4bn!

• Hired new President of Sales- Mike Bokan. He will start October 1.

GUIDANCE:

• We are seeing impact of CPU shortage

• Gross margin to be affected by Tariffs. Working to mitigate impact, but only so much they can do

• 2019 tax rate is expected to be 12.8% 

• Non-GAAP guidance:

    • Revenue: $7.9bn - $8.3bn

    • Margins: 57% - 60%

    • OPEX: $750mm +/- $25mm

    • EPS: $2.95 +/- 0.07

• Will spend $1.5bn in 1st Q to buyback shares

• Will also buyback more shares when they seem undervalued in addition to $1.5bn

• Will not be disclosing predicted margins going forward as they believe “it’s proprietary and not important.” This is a major negative in my opinion.

SUMMARY:

Great quarter for Micron. They did guide down for next quarter and FY2019, but I believe it is because 2019 will be a transition year away from SSDs.

Micron is STILL a buy in my opinion, but I am less confident in Micron after hearing this new call. We WILL need memory going forward, and Micron is one of the leaders in the field.

Full disclosure: I will most likely start taking profits sometime soon & reduce my position and diversify into other companies. Not a bad quarter, but guidance is lower than I’d like. Pricing, unfortunately, is not one of the things you can forecast easily. Demand drivers are still vibrant.

Q/A:

“What % of the lowered margins are from tariffs vs declining memory trends?”

CFO believes it will take about 2 quarters for it to recover and that tariffs account for 100-150 basis points.

That’s reassuring to hear, actually.

Kind in mind, margins in Q1 2018 were 55.1%. While they expect margins lower than this quarter, 56% margins are still higher than last year.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9hj91y/notes_on_microns_conference_call/,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9hj91y/notes_on_microns_conference_call/

",Sellside analysts are two MU the father who beats his son for getting a silver medal in the olympics,"seriously there was nothing negative in that call. They paid back a bunch of debt, beat earnings and revenue but kept the same guidance as before. 

One small thing I believe analysts are missing, and the reason I’ll be buying more shares tomorrow. He talked about the CPU capacity to take more ram continuing to grow. 

Think if half the new Processing units in the already growing cloud, AI and machine learning segments all take twice the ram, that’s a 50% demand increase. And a demand driver no one asked a second question about what they said there. I haven’t done any DD on this but you can be sure I’ll be up all night researching it.

How is that demand driver not given a second thought. Even if growth slows in those segments, more memory per processing unit would more than offset, and possibly enough to offset dram and nand cyclical nature in the coming years.

Free Money Incoming.","I hate the semi sector, and I especially hate all you fags and your $MU meme posting.  But, I couldn't pass up the after-hours fire sale.  Even with the modest downward adjustment to forward guidance, a 7% selloff is hardly warranted given the solid earnings beat, and the stock's already low P/E multiple.  With a stable balance sheet and a pretty damn attractive P/E multiple, I think additional downside is limited, at least in the near term.

Depending on what the IV picture looks like in the AM, I may sell some covered calls on these shares.  The premiums should be fairly juicy.  And since I am never lucky enough to buy the bottom, the premiums will help shield my downside if this bitch decides to shed a few more points in the AM.

If any of you degenerates have a grand long strategy for this stock, please feel free to share.  It's pretty damn hard to find value in this market, but $MU @ $42-43 per share is about as good as it gets right now, in my retarded opinion.

**Overview:**

Selecta Biosciences is a clinical-stage biopharma company focused on oppressing the body’s immune response to make therapies more efficient.  They are combining their tolerogenic Synthetic Vaccine Particles (SVP) to multiple therapies for rare diseases.  They currently have 5 products in their pipeline which range from SVP-enabled enzymes and oncology, to gene therapies.  Based out of Watertown, MA, just outside Boston, the company hopes to treat patients that currently have ineffective or are completely lacking treatments.  

The company not only has a US base, but they also have a subsidiary in Moscow, Russia which is building a pipeline of targeted immunotherapies and vaccines in oncology and infectious diseases.  This is being developed off of their SVP candidates and their hope is to expand their portfolio of immunotherapies in conjunction with the research and development occurring in Boston.

The company has multiple collaborations going on currently because of their SVP product which interacts with the immune system and induces antigen-specific immune responses.  This broad application of the SVP products allows them to collaborate with other companies to test the compatibility of the SVP with their therapies.  

The collaborations that Selecta has are with 3SBio, Duke University Medical Center, Genethon, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Massachusetts Eye and Ear, National Cancer Institute, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institute on Drug Abuse, and 
the Skolkovo Foundation.  


**Pipeline:**

Representing a robust pipeline, this company currently has five different candidates ranging from Preclinical to Phase II while targeting several different therapeutic areas.  

SEL-212 – Chronic Severe Gout

SEL-403 – Pancreatic Cancer and Mesothelioma

SEL-302 – Methylmalonic Acidemia (MMA) – Gene Therapy

SEL-313 – Ornithine Transcarbamylase

Hemophilia A - Gene Therapy - provided Spark Therapeutics with exclusive worldwide rights.


While most of the products are in the Preclinical Phase, there is one in Phase II and another in Phase I.  Our main focus however is on SEL-212, Tophaceous Gout, which is expected to present Phase II five-monthly dose data at the ACR meeting with a pivotal trial to begin Q4 2018.  SEL-212 is a monthly treatment consisting of pegsiticase, a potent uric acid lowering uricase enzyme, administered alongside SVP-Rapamycin to prevent ADA (anti-drug antibodies) which might otherwise compromise the medications safety and efficacy.  


**Specific Drug:**

SEL-212 so far in clinical trials has demonstrated that it has the capability to significantly lower serum uric acid levels down to those conductive to rapid tophi dissolution and the reduction of flares and other symptoms.  

Currently being studied for the treatment of chronic severe gout, the drug candidate shows great promise.  Chronic severe gout presents itself as a high burden of inflammatory nodules of crystalized uric acid (tophi) that have no response to current medications.  This often leads to debilitating flares, gouty arthritis, and a low quality of life.  SEL-212 aids the drug being administer in conjunction by avoiding adverse reactions due to immunogenicity. 

Recently the company presented expanded data from patients receiving up to 0.15 mg/kg of SVP Rapamycin with 0.2/0.4 mg/kg of pegsiticase from its Phase 2 trial of SEL-212, designed to be the first non-immunogenic version of uricase.  The data reported that patients receiving three monthly doses of SEL-212 up to 0.15 mg/kg of SVP-Rapamycin in combination with 0.2/0.4 mg/kg of pegsiticase, followed by two monthly doses of pegsiticase alone.  Roughly 81% of evaluable patients (n=27) had serum uric acid control below 6 mg/dL at week 12, which indicates a great response in bringing patients down to normal uric acid levels which range up to 6.0 mg/dL for females and 7.0 mg/dL for males.  Gout is typically defined as a serum uric acid concentration above 7 mg/dL.  Comparatively, in a separate study of the only FDA-approved uricase therapy, 44% of evaluated patients had serum uric acid control below the 6 mg/dL benchmark at week 16.  27% of all current patients in the SEL-212 Phase II trial experienced gout flares during the first month after treatment with continued reduction of gout flare rates over months two to five.  This represents a massive decrease in gout flare ups when compared to the FDA-approved product for uricase.  

The previous data almost concretely demonstrated SEL-212’s potential ability to change the chronic severe gout treatment paradigm by providing better and more sustained serum uric acid control, fewer flares, and less frequent dosing compared retrospectively to the only FDA-approved product.  This upcoming data set has the potential to demonstrate the extended benefit of utilizing SEL-212 in chronic severe gout patients with high medical needs and pave the path to initiating the Phase III trial which is expected to start in Q4 of 2018.  

Phase II data is meant to represent safety of the drug candidate and to see if it is tolerable.  SEL-212 has been generally tolerable at clinically active doses following repeated administrations in the trial, with 17 serious adverse events, 9 of which were reported to not be related to the study drug, 8 were infusion reactions previously reported, and one was an infusion reaction.  No infusion reactions have been reported following the second treatment cycle and all serious adverse events were successfully treated. 


**Market and Competition:**

As previously mentioned, there is only one product on the market that is FDA-approved for uricase, which as the data above demonstrates is much inferior to the current data being presented for SEL-212.  There are over 8 million individuals in the US alone that have gout, with 160,000 suffering from chronic severe gout and are seen by rheumatologists.  Affecting their daily activities and quality of life, over 34% of individuals describe their flares as severe burns and 28% describe it as painful as breaking a bone.  Astonishingly, on average for patients under the age of 65 there are 25 lost work days each year due to lost productivity from severe gout flares.  

The market of gout therapeutics is going to boom in coming years.  Expected to reach a valuation of $8.3 billion by 2025 and growing at a CAGR of 16.1%, the treatment of SEL-212 shows promise to take hold of a massive share in the market.  The market growth is attributed to the major urate-lowering agents, approval of effective biologics, and increasing number of individuals suffering from chronic gout.  Currently because of the lack of effective treatments, Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Agents (NSAIDs) accounted for the highest share of the market in 2015, which can be credited to highest penetration, higher demand due to low cost, and efficient pain relief.  With the biggest market currently in the US, we are expecting to see a boom in the Asian markets mostly due to increasing quality in health care and better diagnosis of the disease.

The biggest competition in the market includes most notably Horizon Pharma’s gout drug Krystexxa, but also Takeda, Novartis, Savient, AstraZeneca, GSK, Merck, Teijin, and Regeneron. 


**Finances:**

The company has been granted a buy rating with high price expectations by several groups.  This shows promise and great sentiment towards the stock, with their data it is likely they will see high share price in the near future.  The company is however financially stressing at this point.  Their products are all in early stages of development with the exception of the Phase II candidate.  Their chief medical officer also resigned this year with no explanation at the time, causing a bit of worry.  

Their second quarter financial results produced no revenues, down from Q2 2017 due to the company’s grants and collaborations.  Expenses increased by 30% YOY when you compare quarters, a value of $18.8 million for the quarter which resulted in a net loss of $0.84 per share and missing expectations by $0.16.  

As it stands, the company has $66.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and believes that this will be sufficient to fund operations through to Q3 2019.   The current operating plan accounts for funding in preparation for the planned Phase III clinical trial for SEL-212 and initial patient enrollment into a couple of Phase III clinical trial sites, but the company will require an additional equity offering or other external sources of capital to expand enrollment in the Phase III trial and to conduct the planned head-to-head trial against Krystexxa.


**Review:**

This company has a promising pipeline and drug.  The data from the SEL-212 trials so far is incredible when compared to the market competition.  Selecta has several great collaborations with their candidate drugs and has presented almost nothing but good data.  They are making strides in markets that are in demand and have no effective or proper treatments for patients.  They fill an unmet need that will demand a market presence.  

However, beware.  The company is currently in a financial rut, with funds to push operations through for not even the next year, DILUTION IS IMMENENT.  The company will need to raise capital by completing an offering in order to fund their Phase III trials.  I would be absolutely weary of a dilution coming within days of positive news mid October when they present their updated Phase II data.  It would be the perfect time to complete an offering during high investor sentiment as it shows promise and will draw in new investor base. 




#**TLDR**

They are strapped for cash, can only 3 more quarters, will be diluting very soon probably October / November.  I have a FOMO knowing this is a good company & pipeline and that the share price is low from last years over reaction to decent SEL-212 data causing a 50% drop and they did jump over 15% yesterday, but I will still wait. Unpredictable here, up about 30% the past month on expectations, they will get crushed by a dilution and present a perfect buying opportunity.

**Executives**

Howard Tafler – Chief Financial Officer

Herschel Segal – Executive Chairman and Interim Chief Executive Officer

**Herschel Segal**

Good afternoon and thank you, Howard. Thank you all for joining us. Our slate of board members were elected at the annual meeting in mid-June, halfway through the second quarter. Since that time, we have begun collaborative work to reverse the tide of recent negative quarterly results.

We know that DAVIDsTEA is a leading tea company with great products and a recognized brand. We also know that we are in a healthy industry and I believe on the right side of history. Tea remains the second most consumed beverage in the world after water. A February 2018 Euromonitor International report states that the trend over the past decade of consumers increasingly drinking tea continues. This is because Canadians are becoming more aware of the health benefits and the huge variety of tea offerings.

Euromonitor also observed two distinct tea markets in Canada in 2017. There is the traditional market, where products are presented mostly in teabags, that are sold primarily through supermarkets, hypermarkets and discounters. And you have on the another category of players distribute tea in bag or sachet format but currently focus on loose-leaf and organic teas.

As we look for our growth opportunities, we know we must capture more of the teabag market. This can only happen with better pricing and a continued mission to bring consumers a convenient tea experience that they cannot obtain in traditional markets and at the same time, offering consumers the opportunity to purchase our teabags in the traditional supermarket environment.

Two positive actions that have been taken with respect to capturing more of the teabag market: first, we are now working to buy teabags smarter and for less so that we can price our products better for our customers and attract many new ones; second, last month, we launched an excellent program with Loblaw Companies and are now in 450 stores across Canada, including Loblaws, Independent, Zehrs, Valu-Mart, Atlantic Superstore, Dominion, Provigo and Fortinos. These banners now offer a variety of our best-selling, 15-pack tea sachet flavors. This product is merchandised at eye level and the consumer response to date has been very good. This is a great way to further promote our brand.

Overall, we are a merchant operator, first and foremost, and we must deliver the right product at the right price. Therefore, our focus needs to be on improving our purchasing and delivering the brand wherever the consumer wants the brand wherever the consumer wants it. This includes in our stores, bricks and mortar, or online, through other retail channels as well as other potential growth areas such as hospitality and travel markets.

Following a thorough evaluation, we determined that we need to get back to the basics of product innovation and procurement. To make this happen, we have made adjustments at head office to change our operations and our culture. We are building a strong team and we have put more senior leaders in buying, marketing and product development. We are also paying more attention to our costs. As well, we are ready to find a CEO who will enthusiastically adapt to the DAVIDsTEA environment, lead with a realistic optimism and bring vision that will be refined and further developed with the senior executive team and the company's board.

A great deal has been accomplished since mid-June. We are working hard to continually seek improvements, and I feel confident that we are putting in place the steps needed for the future success of DAVIDsTEA.

With that, I will turn the call over to Howard.

**Howard Tafler**

Thank you, Herschel, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin my remarks with the review of our fiscal 2018 second quarter results. As a reminder, the dollar amounts referred to in reviewing our results are in Canadian dollars. Sales decreased by 12% to $40.2 million in the second quarter of 2018 from $45.7 million for the same period in 2017.

We ended the quarter with a total of 239 stores, an increase of three net new stores versus 233 stores at the end of Q2 2017. Second quarter comparable sales decreased by 14.8% as our product offering did not resonate with our customers. We were less promotional as we moved to reduce our dependency on discounting, and we had less products available for our semiannual sale as we were in a better seasonal inventory position compared to the prior year quarter.

In addition, we have revised our merchandising strategy, which has not reflected in our second quarter assortment. This is compared to a 0.9% comp decrease in Q2 last year.

Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased slightly to 43.2% from 44.2% year-over-year as product margin increases driven by less promotional activity and a shift in product sales mix were offset by a deleveraging of fixed costs due to the negative comparable sales.

Adjusted SG&A in the second quarter decreased to $24.6 million from $25.9 in Q3 2017, due to lower stock-based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization expenses. As a percentage of sales, adjusted SG&A increased to 61.2% from 56.7% last year due to deleveraging of fixed costs due to the negative comparable sales.

Adjusted results from operating activities for Q2 2018 recorded as a loss of $7.3 million relative to a loss of $5.7 million in the second quarter of 2017. In Q2 2018, the company recorded an adjusted net loss of $5 million or $0.19 per fully diluted share. This is compared to an adjusted net loss of $4.2 million or $0.16 per fully diluted share a year ago.

Adjusted EBITDA was negative $5.9 million in the second quarter compared to a negative adjusted EBITDA of $2.2 million in Q2 2017. At the end of the second quarter, our ending inventory was $33.7 million as compared to $28.6 million at the end of Q2 2017. In terms of liquidity, we ended the second quarter with $39.6 million in cash. We are continuing to clearly manage our cash position and balance sheet.

With that, I'll turn the call back over to Herschel for some final remarks.

**Herschel Segal**

Thank you, Howard. As previously announced, Howard will be leaving by the end of the month as he has accepted a position in another industry. We sincerely thank Howard for his valued contribution to DAVIDsTEA over the years and wish him every success in his new position. Joe Bongiorno, our Director of Finance, is taking over as Interim CFO while we conduct a search for a permanent replacement.

Further, the board recently named two independent directors recommended by our Governance Committee, Anne Darche and Susan Burkman. Anne is a well-known marketing and consumer trend specialist with a 20-year career in Montreal advertising agencies. She serves on the boards of a number of other companies. Susan Burkman has 35 years in the investment banking industry and has successfully led equity, M&A and valuation and fairness opinion transactions in Canada. We are very pleased to have them both on board.

We have now entered a new era at DAVIDsTEA. Our dynamic management team is focused on what needs to be done as we begin the road back to profitability. I am confident that our shareholders will see improved results within the next nine months, and we will continue to share our progress with you as we move forward. Thank you for joining us today.

Within the next week, JNJ will announce whether they are going to continue the collaboration agreement. If they do, the stock will pop to $10 or more, seeing that 60 millon shares are sold short. That could mean the stock could pop to $15 or $20.

The stock currently trades for $5.50 or so. 

If you want to hedge the trade, puts are selling for about 10% of the stock price, give or take. So you're risking 10% of the trade for a potential 100-200 percent gain.

Status:
Holding, possibly through next ER depending on next few months


Thesis pre-earnings:
-great fundamentals

-bearish sentiment

-buybacks

All noted in previous DD posts


Thoughts:
Figured it was a typical WSB YOLO earnings play, either lose up to 50% or YACHT. Ended up being better than expected after guidance downgrade and rebound going into today. Looks like we hit support so will monitor. Fairly happy with how little I loss considering how the stock moved after the T-word was uttered. Fundamentals haven't changed, just proved it from ER.


Lessons (for you mostly):
-Diversification - you will never win every trade. Going YOLO on one trade no matter how much 100% of a win it seems like will kill you. Even if you win 99% of your trades one bad YOLO play is RIP. See: [MartyMoho](https://www.reddit.com/user/MartyMoho/)

[Proof](https://imgur.com/a/i19x11c): My 5k put into 401k, YOLO into MU thinking it was the safest win. 

-Time - You need time to let the fundamentals work for you. Greens don't grow overnight. Pay the premium just in case you're wrong. Better to get fucked softly and let the fire grow than burn yourself with McDonalds Coffee. 3+ months out at least

-Thesis - if you did your diligence, do not have weak hands if your stock or the overall market dips. It happens. The majority of my plays sits red for up to a few weeks before finally moving in my direction.

-Entry/Exit - regardless of the above, you still need to know your win or loss points.

1. **Decline in  guidance**   
I believe Micron underestimate their earnings. This has been true for quite a while back. I believe they still might hit 3.1 EPS, considering DRAM prices remain stabilized. But it's still way down than 3.5 for the previous quarter. Was the major reason in guiding down related to Intel's shortages of CPU? I don't believe NAND prices have to do much, as the decline in prices is overcome by an increase in demand.  
2. **Effect of share buybacks in short-term on stock price.**  
What would be the effect of stock buybacks on the stock price? Avg trading volume is around 38M which roughly translates to 1.7B value with $45 stock price. They are going to spend 1.5B this quarter, and may increase additional accelerated spending considering suppression of stock price. Assuming they do 1.7B, they are just adding an additional days volume in a quarter. Note that they have already started it.   
**EDIT:**
3. **No longer showing individual margins on DRAM/NAND**  
I see 2 possible reasons for this. First one being, they might want to have even higher margins on DRAM. If they don't disclose it, they can fend off customers saying costs are increasing or something of that sort. I'm not sure if Samsung or SK Hynix give out margins on DRAM, but if they don't, they can collectively raise prices, as DRAM is now a necessity. They can also raise margins on dual chip components. Other reason can be they see their margins getting hit, and don't want to induce panic among investors, this one being highly unlikely IMO. Does it make sense? What could be other reasons?

Theyve found an estimated 38-76M of gold usd (based off potential auction prices for the collector pieces) and have only explored 10m of the 8km vein. 

Mining probabilities say when you discover a vein you discover an average deposit inside the vein and there will be pockets of heavier and smaller deposits.

Has North Carolina hemp based operations for production of CBD. (Senate signing a new farm bill next week and will most likely lift the ban on Hemp in US).

Also into E-liquids and legacy tobacco business with a global footprint.

Did 2b in revs last year, has a chunk of debt.

This sleeper seems to be waking up (last few days has been ~5x avg daily volume), and IMO has lots of upside with its tiny market cap of $200m.

Just wanted to spread the word about this one as I see this may run hard next week with the farm bill catalyst and the low float (even lower than TLRY).

In common shares at $24 and $25, and $30 oct calls.

A) Buy shares at $5.5, sell the 6 strike covered calls for $1.1. Profitable as long as the stock doesn't tank below $4.4, but upside is capped at $6. 

B) Buy shares at $5.5, hedge with the 4.5 strike puts for $1.1. Unlimited upside, but your cost basis is $6.6. Max loss if the shares go to $4.5, but you don't lose any more money if it keeps going down. 

C) Buy shares at $5.5, hedge with put ratio backspread. Sell two of the 4.5 strike put for $1.1 each and use that premium to buy five of the 3 strike puts for $0.45 each. Cost basis is $5.5, unlimited upside. If the price spikes down, gamma will cause the delta on your 3 strike puts you bought to increase faster than the delta on the 4.5 strike puts you sold. This hedge is free up-front, but comes with a margin requirement and is vulnerable to vega because of how inflated IV is right now. 

D) Combine A and C above. Is this a good idea? I have no fucking clue.",$GERN make it or break it this week.,"$GERN receives JNJ news this week as to whether or not they will continue to receive funding. The consensus seems that if JNJ doesn't fund, GERN will tank. If the funding continues, it's expected that $GERN will jump as Imetelstat seems to have great upside.

The announcement must come by 9/30, and some expect it to be by 9/28. All of the options plays on $GERN are focused on this announcement. Between 9/28 & 10/5 there are 3,300 calls and 3,900 puts, the most being about 1,500 10/5 $4.5 puts.

Imetelstat seems to be a great drug, alot of upside and the results so far seem to be good for the patient's they've tested it on. I'd be inclined to get 10/5 calls, but the 1,500 put play is concerning me. What do you guys think, anyone playing this?

",EventBrite - Bullish DD,"After vowing last year never to buy an IPO at opening, I did just that last week. This is more speculative than my usual posts but the participation and underwriting of stock by some serious names and other factors had me willing to throw ten percent of my portfolio at this.  

DD: 

- Despite being in a mature market, revenue is *accelerating*.  The last quarter EB posted revenue growth of 50.93%. Shares are around 5 X future sales which is cheap for a growth stock.  

-T. rowe Price, Sequoia Capital and Tiger Global collectively own close to 50% of the stock which sets a firm floor.  

-Like other tech service plays, the product is clean, easy to use, widely applicable and features a Freemium model (think Match, Spotify etc) 

-The percentage of users employing the ""Paid Ticket"" service is going up.  30% in 2016.  35% in 2017.  

-GAAP losses grew last year as the company expanded but the company is cash flow positive with 250 billion on hand. The company wants to use it to repay debt but has also shown a willingness  to acquire companies as it continues its rapid expansion. 

-Eventbrite does not currently compete with the big dog Ticketmaster which negotiates deals for mega events and does it's own promotion.  EventBrite focuses on smaller events and individual users.  However, negative press and class action lawsuits against LiveNation (Ticketmaster) is gaining steam. Recently the company was in the news when the media found out the company was collecting double fees on it's secretive Ticket Scalping program which is hella illegal. (i.e. They charge fee on first sale. Then someone resells and they charge that buyer a fee again).  Fluctuating prices, and with holding of tickets to artificially prop up prices is also being reported. It's only a matter of time before one of these class action lawsuits gain traction and Live Nations loss will be EB's gain.  

*TL:DR* This is a stock buy and hold. I think the company is reasonably priced at 8-10 times future revenue which is a double for the stock price.  It will be volatile.

From the article - ""... the Oct 19, 2018 $7.50 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today"".

So whoever was buying those $7.50 puts absolutely knew the stock was going to tank days later and they probably got rich off it.

I have since sold out of this position, and sold out of all my $90 puts to date. I am still holding 2 $95 puts which I will likely sell out of on Monday.

$SQ is still showing some heavy selling pressure, and will likely NOT break out of the $90 threshold this week either. If you're still holding puts, I advise you sell out of them this week.

After looking into this from the technical side, you can see that $SQ is still being sold off in large quantities within an hour of market open. 

[RSI](https://www.tradingview.com/x/9iLQODPR/)


RSI is showing that the downward pressure will continue, and we may bottom out at $84 again this week. RSI ended at 37 after several sub-30 visits during the week. This shows a skew towards investors overselling as the stock changes hands. While RSI shows the strength of movement, it doesn't account for the overall flow of money. For this, we use the MFI (money flow index):


[MFI last week](https://www.tradingview.com/x/jUYy9jg0/)

You can see that early in the week, the stock was dumped heavily as money flows out of the stock (the red dotted line indicators). This trend continued at open as many investors are wary of the pullback, and decide to liquidate, even if the timing isn't optimal. Note the MFI of under 20 where there were several hours of trading happening at oversold levels. 

On Thursday, the stock attempted a reversal for the first time, and you can see this on both the RFI and MFI charts. The stock remained stagnant as it approached overbought Money Flow levels. Friday's Pre-Market run-up to 87 was not justified given the outward flow of money, so it quickly sold back down to its resting support of $86.4. 

Towards the end of the trading day Friday, it slipped further. Any of the investors holding on for a recovery this week don't want to hold it over the weekend for fear of a gap-down to the hard-support of $84. Given the poor state of the NASDAQ and tech in general this weekend, their fears are justified. 

I fully expect next week for SQ to stay stagnant at $84-$87 levels, with a possible breakout to $89 towards the end of the week. $SQ isn't dead, but it needs time to heal up from the ridiculous run-up from Aug 28-Sept 5th. The $81-$84 levels were never significantly tested due to consecutive gap-ups. The only thing keeping those levels from being tested now is the fact that even at $85 it is widely considered ""On Sale"". 

My advice? Hang tight this week. If you're holding puts, sell out of them early in the week. If $90 calls are your expectation, you want to date them halfway into October, and wait until mid-week to purchase. $SQ still has some room to slip down, even though the sell-off is slowing, it hasn't completed.

>**1Xnm: On track to achieve total production output crossover in Q4-18 − Achieved 1Xnm crossover in Client and Graphics in Q3-18**

>**1Ynm: Sales to commence in CY-19, with meaningful production starting in Q2-19**

>**1Znm: Good progress on development**


#NAND Technology

>**96L: On track to have production in CY-18**

>**4th generation: Good progress on development; based on Replacement Gate and CMOS under the array architecture**

**This will be the first micron only NAND, without Joint Development with Intel**

>At this time last year, our bit output share was meaningfully below our wafer market share. Over the last 12 months through the strong execution of our 64-layer ramp and a higher mix of TLC, we have reversed this trend and now have our bit share ahead of our wafer share.

>A third-party research firm recently recognized Micron as the number one market share leader in enterprise SATA. We achieved well over $2 billion in annual SSD revenue in fiscal 2018.

>Our first generation NVMe SSD is in the final stages of product development. Looking ahead, **we are focused on introducing new NVMe SSDs over the course of the next several quarters. Consumer and client NVMe SSDs will come first and then late in calendar 2019 cloud and enterprise NVMe drives.** As the market rapidly shifts to NVMe, 2019 will be a year of transition for us following solid SSD share gains in 2018, and we expect to start growing SSD share again in 2020 with a fuller product portfolio. We also look forward to leveraging our market advantage with QLC SSDs in 2019 and beyond.

#Graphics & AI Technology

>More than one-third of our total revenues in fiscal 2018 were from data center and graphics. Our annual revenues in these markets have more than doubled year-over-year. 

Not quite sure what this is it IS NOT XPoint....

>Our collaboration with customers in these markets is deep and we work closely with them to bring new technologies to market.

>**For example, in Q4, we started shipping a new custom persistent memory solution to a large hyperscale company.**

Any guesses?

>In graphics, NVIDIA chose us as the lead GDDR6 partner for their GeForce RTX products, and we expect to see strong growth in our GDDR6 shipments in fiscal 2019. 

>Our automotive business had record revenues in the quarter. We have a strong design win pipeline for automotive products with a lifetime value of several billion dollars. To support our long-term growth in these markets, we recently announced a multi-year $3 billion investment to expand our fab in Manassas, Virginia, over the next decade.

#Xpoint Technology

>We are also collaborating with customers on 3D XPoint solutions and expect to start sampling products in late calendar 2019.

#Other Comments

>**Looking ahead to calendar 2019, we plan to grow DRAM bits in line with estimated industry growth of approximately 20% and plan to grow NAND bits somewhat above our expectation of industry growth of 35% to 40%.**

>In fiscal 2019, we expect that **DRAM profitability will remain strong as the market continues to benefit from long-term structural growth drivers and from structurally slowing supply growth.**

>Turning to NAND, we have seen an acceleration in supply growth in calendar 2018, driven by the ramp of highly efficient 64-layer 3D NAND across the industry. Looking ahead, **we expect the moderation in supply growth, beginning in the first half of calendar 2019 as the industry transitions to more challenging, 96-layer designs, which provide less benefits node-over-node.** We also expect higher demands due to elasticity, resulting in higher SSD adoption and increasing average capacities across multiple end markets.

>In our fiscal first quarter, **we see some impact to our client compute customers, due to a shortage of CPUs.** In addition, there is some limited inventory adjustments underway at a few customers but the end customer demand remains solid.

>As we have highlighted previously, **future technology transitions in NAND and DRAM require substantially more cleanroom space than prior nodes.** As a result, our fiscal 2019 **CapEx related to manufacturing facility construction and facility upgrades is increasing by nearly $2 billion year-over-year**, primarily due to our previously announced NAND and DRAM cleanroom expansions

>We will continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet and use strong free cash flow to support our $10 billion buyback

>DRAM represented 70% of total Company revenue in fiscal fourth quarter. DRAM revenue was up 7% from the prior quarter and 47% year-over-year as Micron executed well in a robust market environment. On a blended basis, **ASPs were flat to the prior quarter, while shipment quantities were up mid to upper single digits percent.** Gross margins for DRAM were 71%, up from 69% in the prior quarter as costs benefited from the ramp of our 1X nanometer technology.

>Trade NAND revenue represented 26% of total Company revenue in fiscal fourth quarter. Trade NAND revenue was up 15% quarter-over-quarter and 21% year-over-year, driven by strong sequential growth in managed NAND products. **Our overall NAND ASP decreased in the mid-teens percentage range and shipment quantities increased in the mid-30 percentage range compared to the prior quarter.** Trade NAND gross margins were 48%, up 50 basis points from the prior quarter and up 720 basis points from the year-ago quarter, driven by robust cost reductions and product mix improvements.

>Capital spending net of third-party contributions was $2.1 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter and $8.2 billion for the fiscal year. While our annual capital spending was well below our CapEx model of low-30s as a percent of revenue in fiscal 2018, we do plan to increase our CapEx as a percent of revenue in fiscal 2019. We currently expect our fiscal 2019 CapEx net of partner contributions to be in the range of $10.5 billion, plus or minus 5%.

>Our investments will continue to be focused on technology transitions for DRAM and NAND while maintaining flat wafer capacity. We expect that about 25% of our capital spending will be associated with facilities expansions and facilities upgrades needed for successful technology transitions. **These expansion and upgrade projects are underway, and as a result, CapEx will be more weighted towards the first half of the fiscal year.** Our strategy is to be flexible and disciplined regarding our CapEx, and we will be responsive to market conditions. **As an example, we’ve cut back our fab equipment CapEx for NAND in fiscal 2019, compared to fiscal 2018 levels.**

>We expect gross margins to remain very healthy in the fiscal first quarter, although lower than fourth quarter levels, and **our gross margins will also be impacted in the near-term, by the announced 10% tariff on $200 billion of imports from China, which will go into effect on September 24th.** We are working to gradually mitigate most of the impact from these tariffs over the next three to four quarters.

>with the desire to keep confidential, as much proprietary information as possible. In doing so, we also review information disclosed by competitors. As a result, **beginning in the fiscal first quarter, we will no longer be disclosing gross margins by our DRAM and NAND product categories.** We view this information as sensitive and proprietary.

#Q&A

>Q. I’m wondering, if you could just help us understand the magnitude of the impact in the fiscal first quarter to the CPU shortages and just sort of the modest inventory correction you’re seeing with some of your customers? And specifically, on the CPU shortages, do you feel like that something that’s limited to the fiscal first quarter or are you -- should we think about that persisting into the fiscal second quarter?

>A. So, let me take the first one to start with. So, on the magnitude side, we’re not going to go into necessarily the details, all the details in a granular fashion. Suffice it to say that they both had an impact in terms of the guidance of 7.9 and 8.3. They are a big driver of obviously, why we guided in that direction. I don’t know exactly how long the CPU shortage will last. I think on the inventory correction side, it will be a couple of quarters before inventory gets reduced. **And I would just add that the CPU shortages, we expect it to be short-term; it’s possible that it goes beyond Q1 as well.**

>Q. what we’ve heard from your largest competitor who appears to be reducing investment and preparing for protracted downturn. So, I guess my first question is, how confident are you that the adjustment you’re seeing is really just a one or two quarter issue?

>A. I think, what’s important to understand is that end-market demand trends for DRAM as well as NAND continue to be strong. I mean, when you look at data center and cloud applications, AI is in the very, very early innings. And the whole cloud growth is in the very early innings as well. We see the DRAM requirements in enterprise and cloud data center application to be growing much faster than the total average DRAM industry demand growth, a CAGR over course of few years of about 30%. Similarly, in mobile applications, DRAM is growing nicely as well as machine learning kind of features, as facial recognition et cetera get implemented in these phones. We are already starting to see 6 to 8 gigabyte, even 10 gigabyte coming in high-end smartphones now. And **days are not too far that you’ll even see 12 gigabyte in smartphones.**

>And similarly, on the NAND front, when you look at average capacities increasing in smartphones, you’re seeing now 512 gigabyte smartphones being offered. And again, **days of terabyte smartphones are not far away.** And certainly with elasticity in NAND, average capacities in client computing applications as well as mobile devices will increase as well as attach rate of SSDs will increase. So, this is important. When you look at these demand trends, we feel very confident about the long-term trajectory. One or two quarters here or there, there can certainly be ebb and flow in terms of demand or supply in the industry. But, the long-term trend is positive.

>And specific to our CapEx, I’d just point out here that we are being very prudent, very disciplined in managing our CapEx, absolutely focused on profitability and ROI. **We have mentioned that our CapEx on cleanroom construction and facility upgrades is increasing by $2 billion compared to last year.** And Dave mentioned that it represents about 25% of our total CapEx guidance that we provided. And just as **an example of our discipline on CapEx management in NAND. In terms of equipment, CapEx for 2019, our fiscal year 2019 versus 2018, we are actually reducing the CapEx fiscal year 2019 versus 2018.**

>So, we are extremely focused on technology conversions, technology transitions because they are the best way for us to achieve cost competitiveness as well as ROI on our investments. **We are not adding wafer starts [ph] where some other competitors may have talked about those in the industry.**

>Q. Question about pricing trends

>A. And you have to keep in mind that the supply growth is slowing down as well, given the increased technology complexity than greater CapEx that is required to implement the technology transition. So, overall, we continue to see healthy DRAM industry fundamentals.

>On the NAND side, as I mentioned that this year, calendar 2018, we see NAND supply output growth at approximately 45%. And this, as you know, has been there because the industry over the course of last several months has gone through major transition from 2D NAND to 3D NAND with the 64-layer. And the industry at this point is already on 3D transition in terms of total bits, on a calendar year basis at about 75% level.

>So going forward on NAND as well, as you look at transition in the future to 96-layer, that will have the same kind of consideration that increased technology complexity and reduced bit gain per wafer from 64 to 96-layer transition. So, we see moderation in the industry supply aspect in the first half of 2019.

>Q. Another Question about pricing, but more specifically DRAM

>A. So, **we’re not going to provide full year guidance on the cost side for fiscal year ‘19.** But, I will tell you that we believe we are in very good position with respect to continuing to execute on our technology and manufacturing roadmap and realizing cost reduction. Of course, as we have said before, **when you go from one technology node to the other technology node you achieve less bits per wafer gain, and that impacts of course the cost reduction capability from one node to the next node. And again, the laws of physics are same everywhere, and this is common across the industry**, as we discussed at our Investor Day.

>**So 1Y technology, in mature yields will provide less cost reduction than 1X technology provided over the 20-nanometer.** Nonetheless, our position will be good in terms of cost reductions. Same things we discussed at Investor Day. We feel very good about our ongoing march towards strengthening our costs competitiveness. And of course, in NAND, we’re in very good position. **In NAND, we are in very good position with the lowest cost technology in the industry.**

>Q. I had a question on the fiscal 2019 CapEx. So, **Samsung is pretty significantly -- well, not just them but both of your peers are pretty significantly reducing DRAM CapEx next year.** And it sounds like, if I strip out the infrastructure and the building portion that your equipment spending on DRAM is going to go up next year. So, I’m asking about the juxtaposition of you increasing your DRAM CapEx when your peers are pretty heavily cutting DRAM CapEx next year. So, I wanted you to talk about that dynamic. And specifically, what it would take for you to cut DRAM CapEx next year? 

>A. So, let me just point out that in 2018, we were well below the industry in terms of overall CapEx. And overall, we definitely are absolutely focused on technology transitions with respect to our CapEx. And we believe we have really a prudent, disciplined focus, as I said before, in terms of adjusting our CapEx toward equipment, targeting it toward technology transitions and big growth coming from the technology transition. We have mentioned that calendar year ‘19, we see our supply and bit growth in line with the industry on DRAM side, which we expect to be approximately 20%. And in NAND, we have said that we expect our fiscal year 2019 supply output bit growth to be -- industry to be in the range of 35% to 40% and for us to be somewhat higher.

>Q.  As we think about what you said about 96-layer an less of an incremental capacity increase when compared to that of 64-layer. I’m wondering if you could provide us some framework of how we should think about the next phase of transitions in NAND in terms of bit output, increases on a per wafer perspective?

>A. So, at this point, we are not providing specifics on 96-layer that how much you gain per wafer. But, I think some of it can be obvious as well. You are going from 64-layer to 96 layers. Future generations beyond 96-layer will tend to have, again reduce bit gain per wafer. All of that is obviously along with the assumptions of industry ramp of 96-layer is baked into our overall guidance of fiscal year -- calendar year ‘19 NAND bit growth of 35% to 40%. **It’s slowing down because again 64-layer to 96-layer will give you less gain. So, in 2018, you saw a onetime increase in NAND bit growth that the industry went from 2D to 3D transition with 64-layer. Going forward, it will revert back to the same curve of less and less bit gain, and of course, more CapEx requirements with each successful technology transition.**

> As in the past, when you went through MLC transitions in the NAND industry or you went through the TLC transitions in the NAND industry, those transitions occurred over a course of a few years. And **we similarly expect that QLC transition to be happening gradually over the course of next few years**, although we will start realizing revenue from QLC SSDs starting now, but, then continuing to increase it modestly in calendar 2019 as well.

>Just want to remind you that we had shared at the Investor Day that in fiscal year ‘17 we had about 40% of NAND revenue coming from our high-value solutions; that means SSDs and managed NAND solutions. And in fiscal year ‘18, we increased that to little over 60%. In fact, in fiscal Q4, our managed NAND and SSD mix, the high-value solutions mix in NAND is over two-thirds. So, this just goes to show you that we are absolutely working towards our goals that we had shared with you at the Investor Day that by 2021 we will have 80% of our NAND revenue in terms of -- actually in terms of managed NAND solutions. So, this is going really well for us and it of course, provides us the benefits in terms of profitability as well.

>if you look at the DRAM demand growth projections in the cloud and in enterprise datacenter space, you will see that that CAGR over few years is 30%. And that is higher than the expected DRAM overall industry supply bit growth of 20%.

I’m a tenured finance professor at a university in the US and I manage a personal account of \~500k.

First, too many people here don’t understand efficient market hypothesis or its implications. Second, I noticed that most people here have no clue of how to create a diversified portfolio or the actual benefits of it (mathematically). You guys like to YOLO, so rather than give you “boring” systematic advice, I will offer you idiosyncratic advice.

I present to you a risky trade, but with high payoffs in buying 11/16/18 puts in FB for $130, and here’s why:

\#1) The general market setting is set up for uncertainty due to the trade war with China and NAFTA with Canada. These risks compound over time so the longer we go without deals, the more the general market will decline.

\#2) FB is in deep shit with the government. Think about the worse-case scenario implications.

\#3) I personally find myself spending less and less time on FB. Coupled with the fact that FB is unable to appeal to the millennial population, this could place significant strain on their ability generate ad revenue.

\#4) If you compare the one-year trend of FB with QQQ, you will see that only began to diverge after FB’s last earnings release in July. Because the problems suggested in #1, #2, and #3 are longer-term issues, divergence can easily extend for 3 quarters to 1 year, to the same extent as Netflix’s pricing issue in 2011 or Chipotle’s E.coli outbreak in 2015.

Due to the above reasons, I predict that after this information will be better recognized by the market after FB’s earnings release in early November. November 16 was chosen to capture a post-earnings announcement drift due to the negative shock of the results.

With a 10% chance of happening, I believe that FB’s stock will decrease by 20-25% from current prices. At the current stock price of about $165, a 20-25% decrease will cause FB to drop to about $120 by 11/16, accounting for both the earnings release and drift. Cost analysis would suggest that buying $1,000 of $130 put at 0.42 each would allow you to buy 23 puts. A $120 stock price will result in a payoff of $22,000, at which point, I would suggest to exit out of your positions.

Again, I think the chances of this happening are 10%. This means you will lose $1,000 nine out of ten times, but it comes with a 22-fold payoff.

(Disclosure: I currently own a small short position in FB in a diversified portfolio.)

TL;DR Buy 130 FB puts, expiring on 11/16. Risk $1,000 for a 10% chance to get $22,000. Don’t get greedy/over-confident.

Many of you are familiar with Geron and the upcoming announcement regarding Janssen (J&J) and their decision to continue in their collaboration.

The Terms:

Stated on Geron's website, if the decision is made to continue, then Geron would receive $65 million in payments initially, with up to $470 million in payments for reaching other milestones along the way. Assuming the continuation decision is made and Geron decides to opt-in to further advance development with Janssen, then the market cap of the stock would immediately rise to 1.6B from the current 1.14B market cap. This would put share price at about $8.90 on the high end. This is about a 43% increase, and that is assuming the share price only reflects the companies' cash value.

Will imetelstat be successful?

Currently, Janssen has an open recruitment for a Phase 2/3 trial of the drug. Previously, Geron and Janssen have completed multiple clinical trials on the product, but the results are not posted to the public. This usually occurs when further research is being done on the drug, and is not necessarily a good nor a bad sign. 

Why is this drug so awesome though? Because of telomeres.
The shortening of telomeres has been a huge problem that pharmaceutical companies have been jumping on in recent times. Essentially, as our DNA replicates over and over again as we age, the protective caps on the end, known as telomeres, shorten over time. As they get shorter, we become more susceptible to the effects of aging, including an increased risk of cancer. With telomere research being hot right now, proof of the efficacy of a drug that directly works on telomerase will pave way for tons of new research in the area. From being a part of the pharmaceutical industry (although I don't work in the science part of it), I hear all the companies talking about how important telomere research is, and how controlling telomerase is one of the steps to preventing or controlling cancer. Janssen knows this, and even though imetelstat might not be used for diseases outside of the current clinical trials (breast cancer, myelodysplastic syndromes), the knowledge that the approval of the drug brings is essential to the development of future drugs.

Sources:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5796239/
https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01242930?term=imetelstat&rank=5

Geron is basically a one-drug company. If the deal falls through, the stock is going to the earth's core. Because of this, I'm being a bit more cautious in this play. I'm expecting a large run-up before the announcement this week (It has to happen before the 30th of this month). I'm expecting a Thursday announcement but I'm only basing that on the fact that JnJ has previously announced continuations on Thursdays, but that really means nothing because they've done it on Mondays and Saturdays before. 

The CEO of Geron, John Scarlett, has previously led biopharm companies to acquisitions. He has years of experience and knows that if this fails, the company will have to cease operations.

I know most of you guys aren't going to read all of this anyway so if you have any questions about my reasoning let me know.

I currently own shares of the stock and plan to sell them on the run-up this week, where I will then open a bullish strap strangle ATM , as I prefer safer plays on biotech stocks like these.

May your tendies be plenty and your RH account green.

I’m in. ,"My take on $PLUG power, near and long term tendies, DD inside","**TLDR**: Buy $PLUG $3 11/16 calls for tendies as Plug Power will see the results of opening new factory, developing robots to take advantage of autonomous forklifts and delivery trucks, and developing new tech to double power storage. $AMZN, $NKE, and $WMT already use their equipment (and will purchase more) and $FDX has conducted 7500mi of deliveries in the Albany area using a Plug Power powered FedEx truck. Institutional investors have doubled their positions by millions of shares and all eight of its board members have purchase shares four times since the beginning of the year.

&#x200B;

**DD**:

WSB listen up - Plug power is going to pop soon with a price target of $3.57, a 90% increase over its current price for the near term tendies. It will increase over the next quarter further as it completes its transition from research company to viable manufacturing company. I have 155 $3 11/16 calls for the near term tendies based around its 11/8 earning report, which I'll then turn over to 3/15 calls for the long term tendies where I expect it will jump yet further.

Walmart, Amazon, Nike, and FedEx have opened contracts with Plug Power for hydrogen powered forklifts and vehicles. Hydrogen power might seem lame but their niche is in industrial forklifts and local deliveries where time spent recharging is thousands of dollars a minute. Their CEO Andy Marsh has also been named to the U.S. Department of Energy Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technical Advisory Committee, giving the business the political connections it needs to succeed. Jonathan Silver, a member of the board of directors, is also a former US Department of Energy official. They are also pursuing European expansion to become an international company, where the political connections will offer them an advantage over their competitor Bloom Energy.

All eight of the board members have purchased hundreds of thousands of shares in the company four times since the beginning of the year, most recently in late August, signalling that they see a positive future for the company as it has turned around from a research company to a viable industrial and manufacturing business. Institutional investors have increased their stakes by millions of shares - Odey Asset Management Group Ltd bough an additional 2,330,000 shares increasing their stake in the company to 4,910,000 shares. Ignore the misleading title of the article and read content for a breakdown of the institutional investor increases: ([https://www.fairfieldcurrent.com/2018/09/23/insider-selling-plug-power-inc-nasdaqplug-director-sells-31343-shares-of-stock.html](https://www.fairfieldcurrent.com/2018/09/23/insider-selling-plug-power-inc-nasdaqplug-director-sells-31343-shares-of-stock.html))

This is also different than a vehicle running on LPG or other alternative fuel. The hydrogen isn't burned in the traditional sense, but is instead run through a membrane that strips the electrons from hydrogen using a catalyst and generates electricity directly from the reaction - the hydrogen then bonds with available oxygen and generates water as a byproduct. The advantage of this type of system is the reduced refueling/recharging time compared to traditional electric forklifts that are used in warehouses, and the reduced emissions compared to traditionally powered forklifts. Their systems are retrofit-capable and can be fitted to currently owned electric forklifts, reducing the overhead of purchasing all-new equipment.

They have also in-sourced the production of the membrane electrode assemblies to further reduce costs ([https://www.gasworld.com/interview-with-plug-power-ceo/2015463.article](https://www.gasworld.com/interview-with-plug-power-ceo/2015463.article)) and opened a new almost 40k SQFT factory in Rochester New York ([https://dailygazette.com/article/2018/08/15/plug-power-adds-factory-in-clifton-park](https://dailygazette.com/article/2018/08/15/plug-power-adds-factory-in-clifton-park)). They used to purchase their membranes for their equipment from their competitor Bloom Energy, and now that they are producing their own membranes they have announced two new pieces of technology - a new membrane that doubles the energy output of its fuel cell system, and their partnership with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the US DOE to develop a robotic fueling station and reduces the time needed to refuel and allows the the usage of autonomous warehouse equipment powered by its system.

EPZM could be next,"Epizyme (EPZM) is a small cap biotech that is developing [epigenetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics) therapies for cancer patients.  It has one drug in phase 2 trials Tazemetostat, a first-in-class oral inhibitor of EZH2 being evaluated for the treatment of hematological malignancies and solid tumors.

The stock has tanked since April when the FDA placed a partial hold on new patients entering the trial due to 1 patient out of 750+ developing a second tumor.  However, the company has provided enough evidence of the safety of the drug to have the hold removed as of [yesterday](https://epizyme.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/epizyme-announces-us-food-and-drug-administration-lifts-partial).  Before the hold, the stock was trading at $19/share and now is only $10 after an initial pop on the hold lift news to $13 couldn't hold.

My theory is the stock is not widely covered and not well known or understood by retail, and additionally a stock that has been in a downtrend for quite some time accumulates a lot of bagholders that are just trying to get out on any pops whatever the cause.  But the hold lift is big news and shows confidence in the drug's potential.  Long term, if it is successful, EPZM could easily have a 10B+ market cap (currently it sits at just 0.7B), and there are 2 other promising drugs in the pipeline in earlier stages.  Analysts agree with me that the current price is undervalued, with an average price target of $21.86 representing more than 100% upside.

Technically, the stock is trading near it's all time lows, but is forming a solid base and showing signs of reversal as it's been in a modest uptrend since bottoming in early August.  Looking at the longer term chart, the stock has tended to bounce between $10 and $20 for the last 4 years.  The company has enough cash to last through Q4 of 2019 with a strong balance sheet.

Biotech investing is risky, and I personally have 3.5% of my portfolio invested in EPZM.  Please do your own deeper DD before making a decision.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9iubzy/missed_amrn_epzm_could_be_next/,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9iubzy/missed_amrn_epzm_could_be_next/

Historically the FDA sides 87% in favor of whatever decision the FDA Advisory commitee recommends. PRTK is currently trading around 9.50 and its one year target estimate is 31.50. Its NDA acceptance date is projected to be early october for its IV pathway for Omadacycline.

&#x200B;

Not only does it have Omadacycline in its drug pipeline, its also has another leading candidate in Sarecycline that its developing partnered with Allergen to to treat acne vulgaris. Sarecycline's NDA acceptance date projected for late december.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: PRTK has two solid drug candidates that have NDA acceptance dates before this year's end, BRING ON THE TENDIES.

Caveat: Even if my expectation of a beat is correct, it could still be annihilated as was its peer KBH, which reported  last night. Was up 6% in the after hours, fell 5+% today.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The below was written prior to the release of the August New Home Sales figuers here:  [https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/index.html](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/index.html)

&#x200B;

These were better than I expected, but June and July figures were revised down.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

DD:

&#x200B;

First, I noted that the New Home Sales figures for the first two months of the third fiscal quarter were significantly higher than in 2017, per [census data](https://www.census.gov/econ/currentdata/dbsearch?program=RESSALES&startYear=2016&endYear=2018&categories=ASOLD&dataType=TOTAL&geoLevel=US&adjusted=1&submit=GET+DATA&releaseScheduleId=).

&#x200B;

Then, I looked at the regional sales growth (click the Tables \[Excel\] [here](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/index.html)) and determined the weakness in the North East (-48.8% declines year-on-year) would not impact Lennar, since Lennar does not operate in those States (see the 10-Q for Lennar's definition of sales regions; none of these overlap with the census definition of the North-East).

&#x200B;

I then confirmed that homebuilder sentiment was still high, lumber prices (everyone was rattled in Q2 about Canadian tariffs) had normalized, and starts had resumed here: [https://www.nahb.org/](https://www.nahb.org/)

&#x200B;

I then went to Redfin's data center to see if things were as terrible as the Redfin CEO seemed to say: [https://www.redfin.com/blog/data-center](https://www.redfin.com/blog/data-center) \- they did not seem to be as catastrophic as he implied, and his words only refer to used housing anyway

&#x200B;

I then read the Barclay's Homebuilder's Report (released 13 September 2018) and noted the various headwinds from mortgage rates and affordability, but saw they were still overweight on LEN with a $63 price target (the lowest analyst target is $56: [https://www.benzinga.com/stock/len/ratings](https://www.benzinga.com/stock/len/ratings))

&#x200B;

I then re-read the Q2 earnings transcript (I had listened to the Q2 call live; analysts were very congratulatory) and affirmed that it had been as positive as I remembered.

&#x200B;

I then noted that LEN's multi-family segment must be part of CNBC's commentary on housing starts in August ([https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/19/us-housing-starts-aug-2018.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/19/us-housing-starts-aug-2018.html))

&#x200B;

\[See Lennar's multi-family segment; it's pretty cool: [https://www.lennar.com/nextgen](https://www.lennar.com/nextgen)\]

&#x200B;

I then bought approximately 30k worth of October, November, January, and February calls when the stock was between 51 and 52.69. Strikes were 50, with some 52.50s in October.

&#x200B;

It then collapsed to it's 52 week low.

&#x200B;

KBH, Lennar's peer, beat earnings: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kb-home-fiscal-3q-earnings-201928257.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kb-home-fiscal-3q-earnings-201928257.html) yesterday, but nonetheless

&#x200B;

I await my fate on October 3rd.

&#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&#x200B;

Why it's down:

&#x200B;

The whole homebuilder segment has been annihilated in expectation of rising mortgage rates causing demand to fall due to affordability issues for buyers.  Not that is made a difference, but the KBH CEO addressed this in the conference call yesterday and said there was no sign of falling demand.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

On days with rake hikes in the past year, SPY usually surges upwards until around 12-2 where it loses momentum and then finishes negative. I might pursue this. Not sure yet. Figure I'd throw it out there for you guys.

&#x200B;

Also funny, usually surges up to +.3% -exactly where it is right now. I would wait for a little downwards momentum before pursuing. Might target for around 2pm, myself.

&#x200B;

One reason to be skeptical: rate hike is VERY expected today. Although expected in past cycles, maybe not as ""baked-in"".  Not endorsing this play, just giving you guys some info lol

The only way you're not going to get fucked over theta is with some deep itm  spreads.

Let's say you did verticles with puts and calls for the same date 2 months expiration after earnings, and you buy these 2 months before earnings, so 4 months total time.

If you closed out these spreads before earnings. I dont see how you could profit, because you'd have to buy back your short contracts, which are no enjoying the most IV increase.

Just spit balling,  no free lunch here",Long Straddles to profit from IV run up pre-earnings,"Alright so first of all, I want to make sure everyone understands I'm asking about buying long straddles **WEEKS** from earnings not the night before. I've seen too many posts where people buy a FD straddle the day before earnings at the peak of IV only to wonder why they lost money ""when the move in the underlying was significant"". 

**Long Straddle and IV**

So now my actual question

IV typically has a huge run up prior to earnings, and a huge drop after the reports are released.

1. Is it possible to take advantage of the IV run up by buying a long  straddle far out from earnings? For example, let's say I purchase a straddle for $AMD strike price 32 exp Oct 26. Earnings report for AMD is apparently October 24. I would sell the day before earnings to take advantage of IV run up.

**OR**

1. Is it too late to purchase a long straddle now?
2. Would it be safer to buy options with further expiration and could further expiration affect IV run up and Vega?

**Risks**

I  know there can be a huge risk of time decay, but I'd imagine the profit  from Vega and increased IV would counteract this? Another way you can  make money from long straddles is hoping for a sharp move in the  underlying, increasing extrinsic value exceeding the cost of the premium, but typically, the move isn't significant enough to counteract the money lost from IV crush and time decay.

**Conclusion**

If  you guys do plays using long straddles, either holding through earnings (not FDs) or selling to profit from IV, let me know what you guys think.

Also feel free to tell me my line of thinking is wrong.

Following this advice doesn't mean you won't lose.

1) Buy options ITM - Higher delta means more gains, ITM options will retain their value and have more opportunity to recover

2) Don't let yourself get within 1 month of expiration - Anything else and you're playing with fire

3) If you're wrong sell early, if you're right let it run - Minimize losses, maximize gains

4) Don't buy options where you're not willing to lose 100% of your investment - Fear of losing the money will cause you to make bad decisions

5) If you are subject to PDT rules, save your day trades for selling losing trades before they give you a huge loss. Try to keep winners until the next day at least.

6) Favor calls over puts - Puts can definitely make money but in general the market tends to go up

7) Favor many small bets over fewer big bets - You want to blow up your account? This is how you blow up your account

edit: One misconception that comes up a lot over some posts I've made is that OTM can return higher than ITM. That's factually false because the delta on ITM is higher and you'll gain more. If you're trying to buy more contracts by buying OTM you're doing it because they are cheaper. Cheap doesn't mean better. It never has and it never will. It takes money to make money. Stop being poor. If you want reliable gains you're going to have to shell out more money. Sorry, not sorry

edit 2: Multiple people have said 3 and 4 contradict. Nope. There's a difference between selling because you know you lost and selling because you're afraid. Expiration date matters. The nearer the expiration the faster you need to declare it a loss, whereas a farther out expiration gives you room to wait if you believe in your position. Never trade on fear, and you avoid trading on fear by not getting yourself into that situation in the first place",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9ja3mh/how_to_win_at_options/,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9ja3mh/how_to_win_at_options/

**Overview:**

Aveo Pharmaceuticals (Aveo Oncology, for some reason they have one name for their company and one for their website) is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing targeted treatments for oncology and other unmet medical needs.  The company has a flagship product tivozanib, a compound that not only provides a long half-life, but servers as an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor 1, 2, and 3 receptors as a treatment for renal cell carcinoma and other types of cancers.  With several partnerships in the works, the company is leveraging their position to develop and commercialize their pipeline which already has traction in Europe.

The CEO, Michael Bailey, has been with Aveo for eight years originally coming in as the company’s chief commercial officer, then served as chief business officer in 2013.  In 2015, Bailey took the position of chief executive officer and president of the company.  Prior to being at Aveo, Bailey worked at executive level positions at Synta, ImClone Systems (now Eli Lilly), and SmithKline Beecham, where he helped market and commercialize drugs such as ERBITUX, CYRAMZA, and necitumumab.  With more than 20 years of experience in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry and experience in commercializing drugs in the oncology space, Bailey brings a solid track record to the table to help advance the company he runs. 

Aveo Pharmaceuticals has 6 different candidates in their pipeline with a total of 10 combined indications of use.  This robust pipeline is headed by their flagship product, Tivozanib.  With three different indications, tivozanib has been approved in Europe as a first line treatment in patients with RCC (renal cell carcinoma) as well as for adult patients who are vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and mTOR pathway inhibitor-naïve following disease progression after one treatment with cytokine therapy for advanced RCC.


**Pipeline:**

With their six different products boasting a total of 10 different indications combined, Aveo shows great promise.  Their lead candidate is tivozanib, which has 3 current indications of which 1 is already approved in the EU since August 2017.  With an already proven treatment and potential for more, it is hard not to get excited about the potential with tivozanib.  The remainder of the company’s pipeline is still very early stage of the development process ranging from Preclinical to Phase III.  They have two different sectors that they break their products down into, Oncology and Non-Oncology.

**Oncology**

Tivozanib:

*TIVO-1 – 1st Line RCC (Approved)

*TIVO-3 – US Phase III Registration Study in 3rd Line RCC (Phase III)

*TiNivo – +Opdivo RCC (Phase II)


Ficlatuzumab:

*SCCHN (Investigator) (Phase II)

*Pancreatic (Investigator) (Phase I)

*AML (Investigator) (Phase I)


AV-203:

*Esophageal Cancer (Phase 1)


**Non-Oncology**

Ocular Form:

*AMD (Preclinical)

AV-308:

*Cachexia (Preclinical)

AV-353

*PAH (Preclinical)


While they do have a robust and outstanding pipeline, we want to turn our focus towards tivozanib as they will be presenting Phase II data at the ESMO this coming October.  This data is representing the TiNivo trial of tivozanib and nivolumab (Opdivo) in aRCC, as an immune checkpoint, PD-1, inhibitor.


**Specific Drug:**

Tivozanib is an oral, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) which is approved for the treatment of adult patients with advanced RCC in the EU.  This potent inhibitor features a long half life which is selective of all three VEGF receptors and is designed to optimize VEGF blockade while minimizing off-target toxicities.  This essentially makes the compound more efficient and potentially less toxic while requiring minimal dose modifications.   In the US, tivozanib is being investigated in a Phase II trial in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s anti-PD-1 therapy, Opdivo (nivolumab) in RCC.  Tivozanib’s distinct tolerability among VEGF TKI’s creates a unique situation where it is a prime candidate to use alongside PD-1 inhibitors.  

The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway plays a significant role in angiogenesis, which is critical in cancer. Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is essential for endothelial cell proliferation, migration and survival. There are five known VEGF ligands (A, B, C, D, PLGF) and three VEGF receptors (1, 2 and 3). Each ligand exhibits distinct but overlapping binding profiles for the three VEGF receptors.


To optimally inhibit the VEGF pathway, it may be critical to effectively block all three VEGF receptors as each plays an important role in cancer angiogenesis:

VEGF receptor 1 is critical for the modulation of endothelial cell survival and vessel morphogenesis;

VEGF receptor 2 is thought to be the predominant receptor for endothelial cell proliferation and migration; and,

VEGF receptor 3 promotes endothelial sprouting and vascular network formation.

Preclinical studies have demonstrated tivozanib is a potent, selective, long half-life inhibitor of all three VEGF receptors that is designed to optimize VEGF blockade while minimizing off-target toxicities.


With that overview done on the drug, lets dive a little deeper into this.

TKIs have recently revolutionized the treatment of RCC while inhibitors of VEGF pathways have become the standard treatment option for patients with RCC.  Tivozanib is a novel VEGF receptor TKI inhibitor which has demonstrated antitumor efficacy.  The unique selectivity of tivozanib has shown minimal off-target toxicities and prevented many adverse effects.  Also, VEGFR TKIs have shown modulation of antitumor immunity, providing synergy between VEGFR and programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibition, showing tivozanib to enhance PD-1 activity through regulatory T-cell reduction.  

When tivozanib was compared to competitors axitinib, pazopanib, sorafenib, and sunitinib, only tivozanib and sunitinib significantly reduced the percentage of regulatory T cells.  Where P = % CD4/CD25/FoxP3 (all regulatory T Cells analyzed by flow cytometry), the drugs produced the following results 16 hours after last TKI application.

Tivozanib – P = 0.034

Axitinib – P=0.908

Pazopanib – P=0.354

Sorafenib – P=0.427

Sunitinib – P=0.002


As you can see, only tivozanib and sunitinib showed a significant reduction in regulator T cells.  However, due to the specify of tivozanib, its unique adverse effect profile makes it an ideal candidate for combination therapies.

The Phase II study of TiNivo is to determine the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerable dose of tivozanib in combination with nivolumab in patients with RCC.  All patients are over 18 that present RCC, which is a measurable disease, and have no prior exposure to tivozanib or nivolumab with a life expectancy greater than 3 months.  Patients of the study received tivozanib QD for 21 days, followed by a rest period of 7 days, and nivolumab intravenously 240 mg Q2W.  Dose of tivozanib included 1.0 mg QD and 1.5 mg QD.   Phase II was an expansion of cohorts of maximum tolerated dose enrolled patients to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of tivozanib. 

In Phase I, no patients experienced dose limiting toxicity in cycle 1 (4 weeks) and MTD was determined to be full-dose tivozanib 1.5mg/d + nivolumab 240 mg.  In Phase II, an additional 21 patients were enrolled at MTD on top of the Phase I 6 patients.  In Phase II, a total of 6 patients discontinued tivozanib and 7 discontinued nivolumab, and there was 1 dose reduction for tivozanib (cycle 6 or 24 weeks in) and a total of 17 dose interruptions. 

For safety, 14 (51.9%) of patients experienced 1 or more grade 3 or 4 adverse effect of any cause.  Nearly half of the adverse effects that were experienced could have potentially been immune-related adverse effects rather than an adverse effect of the compound itself.  These include rash, pruritus, increased ALT, increased amylase, increased AST, increase lipase, sarcoidosis, and diarrhea.  The most common adverse effect was hypertension, but the mean age for patients was 63. 

Preliminary Antineoplastic Activity and preliminary efficacy was assessed in 14 patients who started therapy at MTD and had 2 or more treatment scans, being on treatment for 4 months or greater.  Of the 14, 11 are undergoing treatment including 3 in cycle 8 with a partial response.  The results showed that of the 14 patients, none had seen a complete response, 9 (64.3%) saw a partial response, and 5 (35.7%) showed stable disease with no progression.  No patients displayed progressive disease.  The charts indicate that patients who have been treated for 24 or more weeks almost all saw some partial response, giving the potential that extended treatment will generate a response.  

Although preliminary, the results of the data indicated before a 64% response rate and a 100% disease control rate in patients receiving the MTD suggesting promising antitumor efficacy.  This data demonstrates efficacy for tivozanib in combination with PD-1 inhibitors.  The updated Phase II data to be presented in October of 2018 will hopefully affirm these numbers and show greater response rates and no disease progression in all patients. 


**Current Market:**

RCC is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults, accounting for 90-95% of malignant neoplasms involving the kidneys.  It is estimated that over 63,000 cases of new kidney cancer will occur in the United States and over 14,000 individuals will die because of it.  According to Grand View Research, the global kidney cancer drug market was valued at $4.4 billion in 2016, and expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.4%.  Incidence of RCC is highest in North America and Western Europe.  Globally, there are an estimated 270,000 new cases diagnosed each year and over 116,000 deaths because of RCC.

While previously the treatment for kidney cancer was simply removing the kidney, various forms of treatment methods have been implemented among the currently approved drugs, including immune modulation therapy, cytokine therapy, mTOR inhibitor, and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) inhibitor.

Rising preference for novel immunotherapies and immune-oncologic agents will push the use of targeted therapies to specific patient subpopulations or later lines of treatment. Programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors are poised to displace TKIs and mTOR inhibitors as the standard of care in first-and second-line RCC settings. Combination regimens, specifically those including PD-1 inhibitors will be introduced in the first-line setting to target major unmet needs, giving Aveo a prime opportunity to grab a large share of the market treatment.

Competition in the space includes major companies such as; Amgen/Allergan, Argos Therapeutics, AstraZeneca, Aveo Pharmaceuticals, Bayer, Exelixis, Incyte, Merck, and Roche.

PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors represent a paradigm shift in kidney cancer treatment. Several PD-1 and PD-L1 agents with novel therapies are in early development and are being evaluated both as monotherapy and in combination with already approved immuno-oncology agents.  Again, another position that Aveo has an opportunity to shine in.


**Financials:**

Recently, Aveo ended Q2 2018 with $18.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and generated a total revenue of $0.4 million, the same revenue amount generated the same quarter last year.  Expenses have gone down in R&D and administrative combined.  With a net income of $4.0 million for Q2 2018, the company posted an income of $0.03 per basic share and a loss of -$0.06 per diluted share, which compares to a -$0.30 loss per basic share Q2 2017.  Approximately $11.1 million of Q2 2018 net income was due to the decrease in value of the 2016 warrants which resulted from the decrease in stock price in the quarter.  The company believes that the $18.1 million will fund operations into the first quarter of 2019.  With a market cap of just under $400 million, this small company is going to look to raise funds soon to continue funding their trials, resulting in an upcoming dilution.  


**Review:**

I like this company a lot.  They have a drug in a large, unmet market that is developing and going to grow fairly rapidly.  With an already approved indication and several more products in their pipeline, I believe they will see success.  The data in Phase I showed promise and building off the safety and efficacy of Phase II I believe the additional cohorts put in will bring about positive data in favor of the drug showing specificity and low toxicity.  Having already demonstrated not a single progression in disease, it is unlikely we will see progression moving forward, and we will start to see partial responses from more patients.  

I do expect a dilution in the coming two months, however they did just gain value from the warrant situation, creating an opportunity for the company to take advantage and present a dilution to raise funds to continue operations for the next year or two.  Their burn rate is pretty high but that should be assumed due to their pipeline and stages of development.  The stock has been trading up the past 2 months, almost doubling its low since July.  Although, I have no issue buying below $3.50 for a long term hold.


#**TLDR**

This stock has rocketed up, almost doubling since a low in July, but really just getting back up to support zones around $3.  I think under $3.50 is a buy, they need to dilute to raise cash soon so expect an offering, but with warrants expiring from 2016 and freeing up a bunch of debt the company is in a good spot to do an offering.  I dont see a short term play here, but I do see a long term hold of 1+ year for a solid gain if you are looking for a small company, big bet to add to your portfolio.  It even has options.

You guys seemed to like my analysis so decided to share this, a bit more tech focused, but I thought it was something you guys might like with your obsession with $MU and all] (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9idcgb/micron_q4_earnings_analysis_nand_dram_roadmap)

u/imspartacus811 and I did a great job digging up some information to narrow down what this new memory might be and then collating it into a nice video that follows along with the numerous slides referenced. 

# [Watch Here](https://youtu.be/WqzevlhygKk)

Major talking points include: 

* [TIMESTAMP - 2:19](https://youtu.be/WqzevlhygKk?t=2m19s) - Micron confirmed to be shipping new custom persistent memory to hyperscale company. 

* From [their earnings call](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/9i30bz/micron_q4_earnings_analysis_nand_dram_roadmap), ""For example, in Q4’FY19 (Q3’CY18), we started shipping a new custom persistent memory solution to a large hyperscale company.""

* [TIMESTAMP - 3:46](https://youtu.be/WqzevlhygKk?t=3m46s) - This new custom persistent memory would not be [one of the DRAM- & NAND-based JEDEC standards](http://www.memcon.com/pdfs/proceedings2015/MKT103_JEDEC.pdf) or else they would've publicly shared the variety of standard used. 

* NVDIMM-N (DRAM w/Flash Backup, power loss)
* NVDIMM-F (Flash, block addressable) 
* NVDIMM-P (""Best of Both Worlds"", both DRAM & Flash addressable)

* [TIMESTAMP - 5:47](https://youtu.be/WqzevlhygKk?t=5m47s) - It appears that only Micron can supply this new custom persistent memory and other competitors like SK Hynix or Samsung and unable to do so. 

* At the level of a hyperscale company, supply chain diversity is critical as these companies cannot afford to halt their business operations due to issues procuring parts. 

* If other suppliers could supply this tech, then customers would generally prefer to have a backup supplier, but that doesn't seem to be the case. 

* This kind of thing is somewhat rare. We saw it with Micron being the sole supplier of GDDR5X in the Pascal graphics cards and Samsung supplying certain kinds of exotic HBM (e.g. 8-stack, etc) until SK Hynix could ramp up their efforts. 

* [TIMESTAMP - 8:30](https://youtu.be/WqzevlhygKk?t=8m30s) - Micron has publicly talked about new memory technologies in [past roadmaps](https://imgur.com/a/3pi8woH). 

* New Memory A - Volatile, so it cannot be the new custom persistent memory. Probably cancelled since we haven’t seen a new volatile memory tech since DRAM.

* New Memory B - Probably 3D XPoint, since it closely matches a 3D XPoint slide (https://i.imgur.com/7ru77aS.png vs. prior slide). This cannot be the new custom persistent memory because Micron is skipping 3D XPoint Gen1 and they are sampling 3D XPoint Gen2 in late CY 2019. 

* [TIMESTAMP - 10:18](https://youtu.be/WqzevlhygKk?t=10m18s) - In later roadmaps, 3D XPoint is mentioned separately alongside a “New Emerging Memory” (https://youtu.be/61oZhHwBrh8?t=20m45s, https://i.imgur.com/lKvJbv8.png, https://i.imgur.com/Y7VAsTo.png). 

* The new custom persistent memory could be “New Emerging Memory”. 

[TIMESTAMP - 13:16](https://youtu.be/WqzevlhygKk?t=13m16s) - [Nantero NRAM](https://fuse.wikichip.org/news/1656/nanteros-nram-a-universal-memory-candidate/) might be one possible candidate for this new custom persistent memory. 

* NRAM is a persistent memory technology that has been originally developed by Lockheed Martin and used in aerospace (notably the Hubble Telescope). 

* Nantero took over the technology to move it into less exotic applications. 

* Fujitsu and maybe Samsung are already licensing the technology. 

* Micron could be among those licensees.

&#x200B;

Facebook has a *view as* feature, which allows you to essentially masquerade as another user to see what they see when they visit your profile. This is helpful for ensuring specific privacy settings are working as you expect(I've personally used this feature in the past).

&#x200B;

It turns out that api tokens of those specific users you were viewing as were being leaked when using the view as feature. Now as far as incidents go, this is bad because you can become the user with those tokens. Depending on the permissions of the token, you could potentially read messages, post messages, view hidden info like email addresses, birthday info, etc.  Given that in Facebooks messaging about this breach, they say 50M user accounts were being queried, this could have been a malicious attempt, or it could have been a researcher -- we don't know.

&#x200B;

Remediation for the breach is somewhat straightforward, this is just revocation of those unique tokens we all have which leads to users having to re-authenticate with their passwords/multi-factor authentication tokens(mfa). We saw that process this morning when facebook users were forcibly logged off.

&#x200B;

With Alex Stamos, their former CISO out as of a few months ago, and the cambridge analytica scandal still fresh in everyone's minds, I don't think this bodes well for user confidence.

&#x200B;

Historically, breaches of companies like Target & Equifax have a short term impact on stock price, but long term they recover significantly. Just look at the 1yr for TGT Or EFX. Consumers, unfortunately, forget. The convinence of using their favorite products outweighs the significance of a breach in which they already believe said data is out & about. I think, however, that it's a bit different in Facebook's case, we don't see constant negative memes of Equifax's CEO(or at all) like we do of the Zucc.

&#x200B;

Looking forward to their post-mortem that will eventually come out re: the event. Once that is out, then users will have a true picture of what happened, and what the actual scale of the breach was. 50M can easily turn into many more users during an investigation -- once again very similar to the Target & Equifax breaches.

It's trending down and has been for a while. It's all time low is at $9 and it's currently trading at $9,2 (It's at $9,7 now. Started writing this post Friday morning). The run-up has not yet started so I would say this is a good entry point. We might see this trending up before the decision on Thursday (It has most likely all ready started it's run-up, up 3,19% Friday). 

&#x200B;

But the interest in Paratek has gone up, according to a Bloomberg report. ""Interest in news about Paratek Pharmaceuticals Inc. was unusually high while the flow of information about the company was no greater than average."" Interest in the stock is growing while the price has not yet reflected it. 

&#x200B;

Some information about Paratek Pharmaceuticals:   ""Paratek Pharmaceuticals is a biopharmaceutical company that develops transformative solutions for patients, both in and out of the hospital, with diseases that are not responsive to current treatments. We focus on drugs that target infectious disease and other difficult to treat conditions."" Taken from their website.  

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Well well, they are another Pharma stock. Boring i know. I just wanted more text so you guys think this is some high quality DD and buy this shit.  

&#x200B;

Moving on to their TWO drugs which will both receive an approval (hopefully) on the 4th of October aka next Thursday. Omadacycline (ABSSSI) and Omadacycline (CABP) 

&#x200B;

Starting with some information about Omadacycline (ABSSSI): 

&#x200B;

Acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) have become a challenging medical problem associated with high direct and indirect costs to both the medical system and society.  These types of infections are responsible for more than 750,000 hospitalizations per year, representing a 17.3% increase in hospitalized ABSSSI patients from 2005 to 2011.

ABSSSI includes the following diagnoses:

* Cellulitis/erysipelas: A diffuse skin infection characterized by spreading areas of redness, edema, and/or induration
* Wound infection: An infection characterized by purulent drainage from a wound with surrounding redness, edema, and/or induration
* Major cutaneous abscess: An infection characterized by a collection of pus within the dermis or deeper that is accompanied by redness, edema, and/or induration

These skin and skin structure infections, if left untreated can cause potentially life-threatening infections in bones, joints, surgical wounds, the bloodstream, heart valves and lungs.

[The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)](http://www.idsociety.org/Index.aspx) Guidelines issued in 2010 recommend surgical debridement or drainage of skin and skin structure infections and, where appropriate, initial empiric, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy pending culture results.  Conditions where antibiotic therapy is recommended include:

* Large abscesses surrounded by extensive cellulitis, or accompanied by signs and symptoms of systemic illness
* Abscesses associated with severe or extensive disease (e.g., multiple sites of infection) or rapid progression in presence of associated cellulitis
* Abscesses associated with comorbidities, immunosuppression, septic phlebitis, or extremes of age
* Abscesses in an area difficult to drain (e.g., face, hand, genitalia)
* Lack of response to incision and drainage alone

One of the main challenges in treating ABSSSI is [antibiotic resistance](https://paratekpharma.com/science/antibiotic-resistance/).  In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the prevalence of severe ABSSSI requiring hospital intervention caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens, in particular methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA) strains.  Beginning in the mid-1990s, the prevalence of MRSA shifted from healthcare-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) to community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) strains.  CA-MRSA is now the leading identifiable cause of purulent skin and soft tissue infections in emergency department patients in the United States.  Typically, upon hospitalisation, a patient will be treated for an antibiotic resistant ABSSSI with one or more intravenous antibiotic.  

&#x200B;

Also some information about Omadacycline (CABP): 

&#x200B;

Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) is a lung infection caused by bacteria that develops in people with limited or no contact with medical institutions or settings.

* The most common symptom of pneumonia is a cough that produces sputum, however chest pain, chills, fever, and shortness of breath are also common
* Doctors diagnose community-acquired pneumonia by listening to the lungs with a stethoscope and by reading x-rays of the chest

CABP ranges in severity from mild infections that are successfully treated with oral antibiotics in the outpatient setting to severe infections that require hospitalization and treatment with monotherapy or a combination of intravenous antibiotics. In the most severe cases, CABP can result in complications such as respiratory failure and septic shock.

While several bacterial pathogens can cause CABP, *Streptococcus pneumoniae* is the main culprit with about 500,000 cases of pneumonia in the United States each year. Pneumococcal pneumonia is a leading infectious cause of hospitalization and death among US adults.

According to the Center for Disease Control, antibiotic resistant *Streptococcus pneumoniae* in the United States is responsible for:

* 2 million resistant infections per year
* 19,000 excess hospitalizations
* 7,000 deaths per year

The emergence of antibiotic resistant *Streptococcus pneumoniae* is an increasingly common problem in the United States and elsewhere, with more than 40% of all pneumococci falling into this category by current in vitro definitions of resistance.

&#x200B;

*Staphylococcus aureus* is another bacterial pathogen that may cause CABP.  Since the year 2000, the number of cases of pneumonia caused by *Staphylococcus aureus* that are resistant to some types of antibiotics has increased. This bacterium is known as community-acquired methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (CA-MRSA), and it can cause severe pneumonia.

&#x200B;

What can Omadacycline do: “Omadacycline is a modernised tetracycline antibiotic with the potential to help address the urgent and growing need for new agents to treat serious community-acquired infections,”  Evan Tzanis, chief development officer for Paratek, told Infectious Disease News.  “If approved, Omadacycline would be the first once-daily IV and oral antibiotic in more than a decade.”  I smell rocket fuel... lol. 

&#x200B;

Source: [https://www.healio.com/infectious-disease/antimicrobials/news/online/%7B8c111960-478c-48f4-ba73-e15ab2f35d56%7D/fda-committee-recommends-omadacycline-for-approval](https://www.healio.com/infectious-disease/antimicrobials/news/online/%7B8c111960-478c-48f4-ba73-e15ab2f35d56%7D/fda-committee-recommends-omadacycline-for-approval)  

&#x200B;

They are both currently under ""priority review"" and as I mentioned before the decision is on the 4th of October.   Also ""According to Paratek, omadacycline was recommended for approval based on safety and efficacy results from phase 3 clinical trials."" ABSSSI was voted for approval with a result of 17-1. CABP was voted for approval with a result of 14-4. 

&#x200B;

So if these two drugs get approved they will be the first daily Omadacycline drug in the last decade with diseases which actually are harmful. CABP which has 7 000 deaths each year and another 19 000 people which are hospitalised. Then ABSSSI which has 750 000 people hospitalised each year. It feels like these drugs could help a lot of people if approved and with already good results from their Phase 3 trial and not only that, they have both been voted for approval with great results it seems that these will get approved, yet the stock has not shown any big movements. 

&#x200B;

Now, I am no expert but I believe that this will be a good play for next week. This is some DD i have gathered. I will add more if I find some thing interesting. 

&#x200B;

If both manage to get approved this thing will rocket. I also feel that both will get approved or neither. Which makes it easy, we either go to 0 or the moon. 

&#x200B;

Also they have another FDA approval coming up the 19th for Sarecycline. More info on that yet to come. 

&#x200B;

Disclosure: I do not own positions for PRTK yet. 

&#x200B;

Good luck boys!

[Covered Calls Income - August Recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9ci1dy/covered_calls_income_august_recap/)

&#x200B;

Here are [my trades](https://i.imgur.com/5zMjvLX.png).  I'll explain each one and plan what I should do next month.

1. BABA Put **\[NET GAIN: $543.20\]** : I made a post with [very comprehensive and in-depth DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9d6pxg/sorted_by_new_and_saw_a_bunch_of_mu_and_amd/) on BABA, which for some reason was NOT well received. I collected my premiums on this trade, however I got assigned. I now own 100 shares of BABA at $167.50/share. For October, I will be selling a covered call on my position at a strike price of either $167.50 or $170.00. *Commissions on this trade may look a little steep. This is because I made a wrong trade that only cost me commissions, so I added the commissions on to this trade.*
2. IQ Calls **\[NET GAIN: $189.75\]** : I am still the proud owner of 200 shares of IQ. My cost basis on those shares is $31.05 per share. I sold two calls with a strike of $31.50. My shares were not called away. **SO FAR THIS MONTH I HAVE MADE $732.95 SELLING OPTIONS.** *These two trades are the end of my selling options. You may have noticed some degeneracy on my trades.* *^(Let me explain.)*
3. MU Calls **\[NET GAIN: $297.10\]** : I am still the owner of 100 shares of MU. I did not sell a call this month because my cost basis is $52.36/share, and the premiums were not worth it to me. However, after Micron's ER, the stock dropped and I saw it was hitting a support level of around $44.00/share. I bought 10 Calls for $2.00 and sold at $2.32. I'm a little upset with myself for not selling at $2.70 (I held these calls too long, if I had sold the same day I bought them I would've made $700), but no one ever went broke taking a profit.
4. MU Calls **\[NET GAIN: $77.10\]** : I tried recreating what I did on trade #3. I made less money, buy money is money. I made $374.20 this month buying MU calls.

This month, I made $1,107.15. But the point of this post is to encourage selling options, so this month I made $732.95.

&#x200B;

My portfolio consists of...

100 Shares BABA @ $167.50

200 Shares IQ @ $31.05

100 Shares MU @ $52.35

This is a dual scoped analysis of Paypal’s expected trajectory for the upcoming weeks. Paypal is expected to report earnings on 10/18/2018, which is 3 trading weeks away. Historically, Paypal receive a heavy sell-off pressure into the earnings period.

If you’ve followed my previous analysis, you can see the notes about my expected trajectory for Paypal’s stock price. My personal expectation is bullish, despite the below Technical analysis which I’ve previously informed. If you followed these trades, as several of you have, you could have made a hefty profit on $90 Paypal puts for 10/12/18. 

I PMed this guidance out to several of you 2 weeks ago, and posted it in the daily thread last week, but it is worth repeating here:

    Here is an example using PYPL, one of my favorite stocks. TA 
    is only relevant here
    because PYPL is a service-based company and there is very 
    little Fundamental change to their business model. Outside of 
    launching Venmo, their main driving force is the volume of 
    transactions which grows every quarter. The price goes up 
    between earnings calls because investors are simply 
    assuming that on the next 10Q form, they will announce a 
    higher volume of transactions, showing the growth of their 
    network. Investors don't know the volume until it 
    announced, so Investor speculation is the real market mover 
    for Paypal.
    Paypal has been on an updward wedge trend all year. As the 
    trend continues, you can see the trend losing strength. Every 
    time Earnings Call happens, the stock tanks back to the 
    bottom 
    of the wedge as a lot of people take profits. Next earnings is 
    on 
    the 18th of next month. Depending on how that earnings call 
    goes, this may be a strong opportunity to play Puts on PYPL.
    Take a look at this graph:
    https://www.tradingview.com/x/QldBPnit/
    When you look at the overal theta of the trend (the rate at 
    which the trend loses strength), it's becoming much less 
    reliable. And then if you take a closer look at the past 30 
    days you will see why I'm not so bullish. If the wedge trend 
    continues, we would have expected PYPL to test a new ATH 
    of $94.1 on it's last run, up. Instead it hit the same high as 
    the last run-up, and it was quickly sold off to a lower price.
    Here's what I mean:
    https://www.tradingview.com/x/KcUv4xHr/
    My play for PYPL would be wait until this Friday, if PYPL 
    passes $91 again, I would load up on some $92.5 puts 
    expiring Oct 19th. The earnings is on the 18th, which    
    almost always results in a sell-off. Combined with the hard 
    resistance at the $93.5 line, I think it will be significantly 
    oversold and probably drop back into the mid $80 range.
    The one risk you're running is stellar guidance on that 
    earnings call. If PYPL announces that Venmo has gained a 
    ton of traction, or they grew transaction volume by more 
    than 30%, your puts will become worthless.

Slowing rising wedge:

Double Top:
https://www.tradingview.com/x/KcUv4xHr/

These days have come and gone, and as you can see, PYPL is sitting at the expected mid 80’s levels. 

I originally targeted the PYPL bottom for friday to be $88.3 but it slipped further, scraping the $87.3 levels several times. With this in mind, and based on the strength, and money flow of this sell-off, I think Paypal may still continue to bleed next week. 

Here is my bearish analysis of the coming weeks for PYPL: 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/tmglgyTM/

Here is the corresponding bullish analysis :
https://www.tradingview.com/x/GnVEsb5Y/

Where am I putting my money? 

I am currently holding calls for 88c 10/19, 89c 10/19 and 90c 10/19. I feel comfortable with these positions because overall my stake is around 1.8k and I already made 1.3k on the original bear analysis from last week. Whether it goes up, down, or sideways, I’m still playing with the house’s money and 500 of my own which I can stand to lose.

Where should you put your money?

I think that it’s a bit late in the game to hop on the Put train, but if you feel more swayed by the bearish pattern, it might bounce all the way down to $81 before earnings. I am more inclined to waiting out until wednesday and trying to buy calls on the bottom. 


My positions:

PYPL 88/89/90C 10/19 - See above

LMT 345/347.5/350c 11/19

**Disclaimer: I am long on all of the positions above except for AXP 110c 10/12.**
 
With that said...


**DONT LISTEN TO ADVICE FROM ANYONE ON TRADING STRATS REGARDLESS OF THEIR TRACK RECORD. IF YOU FOLLOW MY (or anyone else's) TRADES YOU COULD EASILY LOSE ALL YOUR MONEY AND THEN KICK YOURSELF FOR NOT EVEN MAKING YOUR OWN FINANCIAL DECISIONS. ONLY ONE PERSON CAN MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS AND THAT IS YOU. REMEMBER THERE ARE ALWAYS 2 SIDES TO EVERY TRADE. EVERY TIME I MAKE A 200%-300% PLAY THERE IS SOME POOR SAP ON THE OTHER SIDE WHO PROBABLY THOUGHT HE WAS BEING ""INFORMED"" BY SOME ""GURU"".
THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE PATH AND IT IS THE PATH THAT YOU CHOOSE.

What if you could reverse, the reverse, of what WSB is doing.

Now, as some of you faggots might know, the time honed tradition of reversing wsb pays off.  If some genius says buy long amd FDs, for example at the beginning of last week, a smart decision would have been going for puts instead, as shown below in this great chart 

https://i.imgur.com/Z9Y7USO.jpg

But now there are too many faggots reversing wsb, resulting in both options being bad.  Now if someone said reverse that, your first thought might be that you go back to square 1.  

not so fast

https://i.imgur.com/XUZ07TC.jpg

As you can see from the great above chart, anyone can easily reverse, the reverse, of WSB consensus.  But that doesn't mean you'll make money, as trying to go with that option this week would have killed you.

But what if we took this to a whole new level?  One that hasn't been infected by WSB yet, and probably hasn't even been thought of?  Coming to your now screens, reversing, the reverse, of the reverse, of WSB consensus:

And thats how you know that buying puts on TSLA is a good idea when people say to buy amd

Now you too can do 3d investing, so go out there and make some great bets

Trump holds all the cards. And he will walk away with everything he needs. 

Also he doesn't care about the deadline. He knows that he can negotiate with Congress to pass the Mexico only deal.

EDIT: Another reason is if he agrees to taking down dairy industry protections he is fucked in the province of Quebec (which represents 20% of the seats in parliament)  as most dairy originates from there. And if he lets the Auto tariffs come into effect he loses Ontario which represents 25% of all seats in parliament. And both Quebec and Ontario are his power base.

&#x200B;

Taken directly from their website - [www.trevena.com](https://www.trevena.com)

# At Trevena, our mission is to deliver innovative medicines to patients and healthcare providers confronting serious medical conditions.

[Oliceridine injection](http://www.trevena.com/Oliceridine.php), our lead product candidate with FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation, is a next generation IV analgesic in development for the management of moderate-to-severe acute pain.

&#x200B;

Following this [link](http://www.trevena.com/trevena-pipeline.php) you can find the company's current pipeline. The drug in question is TRV130 Oliceridine. 

&#x200B;

"" Oliceridine injection was designed to optimize opioid receptor pharmacology using Trevena’s proprietary platform to deliver an improved analgesic profile compared to conventional intravenous (IV) opioids. Oliceridine injection is the first G Protein-Biased Ligand at the μ-opioid receptor, and is in development for the management of moderate-to-severe acute pain where IV therapy is preferred. 

&#x200B;

 In February 2016, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy status to oliceridine injection. This designation is granted by the FDA to new therapies intended to treat serious conditions and for which preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial clinical improvement over available therapies. In January, 2018, we announced that FDA has accepted the oliceridine injection new drug application for review with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act review date of November 2, 2018. ""

Phase 2 results

[http://www.trevena.com/pdf/Singla\_et\_al.\_J\_Pain\_Research\_2017102413-24.pdf](http://www.trevena.com/pdf/Singla_et_al._J_Pain_Research_2017102413-24.pdf)

&#x200B;

It is a lengthy read so here is the summary. 

&#x200B;

 Results: Two hundred patients were treated (n=39, n=39, n=83, and n=39 in the oliceridine regimen A, oliceridine regimen B, morphine, and placebo groups, respectively). Patients were predominantly female (n=198 \[99%\]) and had a mean age of 38.2 years, weight of 71.2 kg, and baseline pain score of 7.7 (on 11-point numeric pain rating scale). Patients receiving the oliceridine regimens had reductions in average pain scores (model-based change in time-weighted average versus placebo over 24 hours) of 2.3 and 2.1 points, respectively (P=0.0001 and P=0.0005 versus placebo); patients receiving morphine had a similar reduction (2.1 points; P<0.0001 versus placebo). A lower prevalence of adverse events (AEs) related to nausea, vomiting, and respiratory function was observed with the oliceridine regimens than with morphine (P<0.05). Other AEs with oliceridine were generally dose-related and similar in nature to those observed with conventional opioids; no serious AEs were reported with oliceridine. 

&#x200B;

Conclusion: These results suggest that oliceridine may provide effective, rapid analgesia in patients with moderate to severe postoperative pain, with an acceptable safety/tolerability profile and potentially wider therapeutic window than morphine.  

&#x200B;

[http://www.trevena.com/pdf/Viscusi\_et\_al\_PAIN\_2016.pdf](http://www.trevena.com/pdf/Viscusi_et_al_PAIN_2016.pdf)

&#x200B;

Also another lengthy read. 

&#x200B;

 The analgesic efficacy of TRV130 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain was achieved without SAEs. Although proof of concept was demonstrated for analgesic efficacy, robust tolerability comparisons were limited by dosing methodology and modest sample size, and future studies are needed to continue to assess tolerability. These results also suggest CU for TRV130 at different points on the dose-response curve: Higher doses may provide previously unachieved reductions in pain intensity in clinical scenarios that require greater analgesia, with dose reduction as an option to preserve sufficient analgesia with fewer ORAEs than experienced with conventional opioids.

&#x200B;

 In summary, this study demonstrated TRV130 analgesic efficacy in patients experiencing moderate-to-severe acute pain in a bunionectomy model. In-study comparisons to morphine suggest that G-protein-biased m-opioid receptor activation may enable increased efficacy with acceptable tolerability vs conventional opioids.

Now looking at older posts of $TRVN it seems like it hasn't been performing too hot. There haven't a whole lot of posts regarding this company in the past year. The most recent one was 3 days ago. Mentions of morphine being cheaper than this drug doesn't look like good news. It's going up against something which has been a staple in the medical community for many years.

[PG&E has 5.4 million electric customer accounts, 4.3 million natural gas customer](https://www.pge.com/en_US/about-pge/company-information/profile/profile.page). If y'all think Cali or the Fed will let all those customers just be shit out of luck, you're crazy. People NEED electricity and natural gas.

If PG&E does go to court and gets sued for a bazillion $$, it'd probably just be a bailout scenario IMHO. Or they just pass on the cost to their customer base and recoup their losses that way. Entergy does the same thing in Texas / Louisiana, if they lose a lot on plants going into outage or their traders are idiots, they just raise the cost $/kWh and bam, books are good again. I've heard stories of Entergy making like $2 million a day once on a trade and the trader got in trouble for making it look like the company doesn't need to raise rates..",PG&E Corp $PCG - Discussion Thread,"I keep seeing more and more posts on PCG. Lets limit the discussion to this thread. She's up 48.82% as I am typing this right now. What a huge move after hours. I profited on my puts twice and sold them yesterday morning. I had 11/16 $25 puts with an average price of $1.50, I sold them each for $6 to secure my gainz. Prior to market close yesterday (3:50 EST) I was like fuck it lets try it again, got 11/23 $22 puts with the profits at an average of $5.10.

\-From what I have read and discovered, the after hours price movement is due to an official(s) stating that they will not let PG&E go bankrupt and there is a California law that protects that from such a disaster. There are a bunch of other rumors such as another location that started the fire etc...

Main question now is double down on puts or sell for a loss and hop onto calls.

If anyone scooped up 11/16 calls - you're fucking rich today
